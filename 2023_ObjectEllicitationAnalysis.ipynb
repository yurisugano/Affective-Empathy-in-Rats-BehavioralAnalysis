doesnt roll very well and it kind of thumpsdo you want me to talk louderum and it kind of thumps when you throw it it doesnt bounce or anything then this one 201 is pokey spiky ooh and it lights up when you bounce it it also doesnt bounce that much but still it feels really artificial like kind of slimy almost um like i definitely wouldnt put that in my mouth this one 203 has little suction cups all the way around whichoh i like the sound it makeslittle popand it does roll well but its not satisfying at all yeah this one 202 is my favorite its its smooth and soft and it bounces well and its heavy like its solid and its a little squishy if i like put some effort into it and yeah so this one i think rolls well then the suction cup 203 does too but again just not satisfying i like this one 201 this feels like the kind of thing youd have like at a party or youd get it from a vending machine like a gumball machine like at old navy yeah and then this ones 204 like a hacky sack is what i think of theyre all 201204 different colors this one 204 i feel like would be really great to throw when youre mad because it doesnt do anything but yeah kind of rough but i i really like the material its i dont know um rough but like also smooth at the same time theres a pattern etched into it which i like its just satisfying this ones satisfying i like the spiral that you can feel it gets denser in the center but this one 202 is my favoritethank youok good it really bothers me that theyre all different colors you asked umm yes so these two 205 206 while being different shapes are the same to me because they feel the same again its like kind of likewait compared only to each other not in relation to other groupsso these two kind of feel like this blue spiky one 201 just again like artificial and slimy and like every piece of dust will stick to it but i really like that its 206 hollow that theres like a you know that its just the shape of it but no inside i like that you can see through it and the colors 205 206 i like the colors oh its 206 a little bouncy but kind of the same like just a little bit and its soft 205 206 which doesnt like this 205 is technically still like spiky cause theres stuff coming out but this 205 feels softer probably cause of the balls on the end this one 208 is i mean its a globe its a sphere its not the same as that 202 though its 208 like very very light while that one 202 was dense and its 208 very smooth its very smooth in a different way its not soft its just like smooth all the way around yeah thats all i gotta say about that one 208 and then this one 207 again its not spiky like that one despite having all the things its its squishy and its its like wet spaghetti um it kinda reminds me of play dough a little bit just feels like that and the texture isjust trying to think how to describe how it feels in my hand like its just pleasant it feels really nice and pleasant kind of like a makeup brush uh brush it on your face and even though it is also artificial its a different feeling i like this one thank you this guy 209 i dont even know what to say about this guy its not squishy hes pretty firm um kind of has the texture or like the feel of silly putty like smooth but like dense this 212 isi dont know it feels it feels pretty i dont know how to explain that its just very smooth and not soft but like silky like it feels clean and symmetrical and i like that this one 210 i mean its a stress ball so i can definitely squeeze it quite a bit which i like so its squishy and like that its a brain squishy i like all the indents because its smooth but then theres ridges to it and curves and i like that this one 211 i already dont like even just by looking at it because again its superi dont know i have bad memories attached to stuff like this its just like everything sticks to it so its like slimy again but also just like you can feel all the dirt and hair that stuck to it but also when you squish in its the weirdest feeling cause you can feel the dolphins on the inside and every time it feels like youre gonna pop it but you dont so every touch kind of slides it thats what it isits slimy and it slides it does roll but thats where it attracts all its things and you can kind ofif you really wanted to put effort into it you could probably stick a finger or something inside the end but squishy very squishy and slimy kind of gross i feel like this one 212 i already talked about it but i i like that you can see through it and i like that you can feel almost not sharp but something at the top where the hole would be kind of rough i like that in comparison to the rest of it yesthank you im intrigued so this ones 217 felt i think now that i say it out loud i am not as confident and this is rough in the sense that you can feel kind of into it like this one 218 you feel the top and thats all there is this one 217 it almost feels like you can feel all the little edges and grooves in the in the material um its also very uniform along the sides and i like that this one 218 is veryoh this 217 and this 217 is also thicker its like just thicker this 218 is very thin and it almost feels like when i touch one side i can also feel my finger on the other side and the edge is a little um stringy because theres all the little edges and that kind of reminds me of this 207 a little bit if they were longer but 218 very thin and not rough in the same sense like smooth rough its like much smoother but still its its not soft thats what it is its smooth but its not soft folds the already explained fabrics in half um this is 220oh i like thisi like this because you can feel all the holes and trace the shapes theres almost different layers to this one its not rough but again you just like feel more with it or theres more to feel and the other sideoh the other side is is smooth unlike this one which feels like again the materials a little almost scratchy little itchy like i feel like if i wore it id probably be uncomfortable a little bit but this side i really like its a very smooth very pleasant i actually like it better and its stretchy because i can kind of pull it out which i really like and this one 219 kind of feels similar to this 218 in that its smooth and that theres all one layer but it 219 feels heavier almost a little thicker a little denser and yeah this 218 is much thinner this 219 is thicker and i quite like this these two 218 219 feel very similar because theyre both very smooth and while i would think that these two 217 220 would feel similar cause theyre both rough theyre not like this 217 just feels scratchier like this 217 is scratchy and this 220 is itchy if that makes sense and this 220 is also just stretchy and this 217 is pretty dense in one sense and in one place yeah yeah that is all sorry ocdok i dont like any of these 221224 ok so this 223 is furry just from like sight this is furry this 222 is fluffy and this 221 is fuzzy and this 224 is just awful this 224 just feels again like itchy scratchy like like this one 217 again or both of 217 220you know this 224 is like a net almost its super rough like umlike weaving like a basket material kind of rough this 223 is fuzzy and i i just hate fur furry sorry furry very soft though like the hair itself which is soft it doesnt feel as artificial as a lot of things do like this could be a good rug and the backside feels like this actually also kind of rough and itchy this 222 is alsoalso soft but this 223 is furry and just kind of fluffy no furry and this 222 is fuzzy yeah this is fuzzy and very soft and much more pleasant to feel because i hate hair and then this 221 isok furry 223 fuzzy 222 ahh this 221 is soft and i mean it its velvety thats like the best way to describe it because its velvet velvety and its not soft in the same way like this 222 is fuzzy this 221 isntits almost silky even though its not silk its not silky but like theres a uniform feel to it like this 222 feels like i get different things but this 221 feels more uniform like all the way down andbut in the other direction its the opposite like this way is soft and this way it feels like im going against the ridges so its like pulling against me im trying to differentiate between these um furry 223 but soft fuzzy 222 but soft smooth 221 i think maybe smooth soft velvety silky and this 224 is rough oh its like burlap thats sorry sorry thats what i was thinking burlap its like itchy and scratchy but very useful um i think thats all i have to saythese two 209 212 are the only ones thatthe heart and the alienthat dont feel like anything else like everything else kind of had a similarlike these two 205 206 felt the same and this 201 this 208 felt the same as this 202 which is interesting because these 205 206 are different shapes and these 202 208 are the same shape and they felt the same oh sorry sorrythese two 205 206 feel the same as this guy 201 even though theyre all different shapes but this 208 only feels the same as this 202 because theyre the same shape and this 211 also feels like this 205 206 201 because of the materialsorry sorrybecause of the material um i guess when you feel this 211 one too it like shifts in your hand it feels like its sliding down the weight shifts while the others kind of have a distributed weight and these two 209 212 just dont feel like anything else i dont know the texture just doesnt really remind me of the other ones and fabrics really gave me a hard time um i think thats all yeah ok thank you ',

and i would play with them and i was alwaysi would always like to do this rolls ball on table so it sticks and unsticks it makes popping sound and like make popcorn noises so its also different colors red blue and green my hair is in it now its ok but this is cool too its also a sphere but in like a subtle way because the middle is like a hard little circle and then this forms a circle but its like all these little things ok ooh this 202 reminds me of like a pencil eraser almost just in the way it looks and like the way it feels im not super familiar with a bouncy ball like this its kind of like softer than a normal bouncy ball like i feel like if this hit me it like wouldnt hurt as much i dont know if thats true but i feel that way but yeah its cute has the little barcode on it so yeah thats an observation it has good bounce its its a good like i feel like its a good classic bouncy ball although i do feel like it could be susceptible to like getting dirty because of how like soft it is and how light it is but yeah stay and this 204 is a hacky sack i have two hacky sacks at home yes mylets see its like woven or like its made of like thread which is cool and it has like little probably like beads inside of it just based on my knowledge of hacky sacks um and yeah youre supposed to like throws and drops 204 ok well if youre good at it youre supposed to like be able to like bounce it off your body but if youre like me you cant do that but i like the colors on it the top kind of reminds me of like a strawberry almost but yeah i feel like all of these things 201204 serve different functions even though theyre the same shape but the function is fun just different kinds of fun is that enough ok that is what i have to say about these 201 lights up again ok ok i forgot it does that okok gotcha gotcha im not on a timer now ok this 205 is really interesting still like some sort of like ball type thing but i feel like thelike it doesnt bounceyou know it bounces in different directions because of all like the angles on it i also kind of like rolling it around like i feel like you could use it as a muscle roller oh ok have to observe it so it looks like stars that are like bunched together and theyre all different colors and theyre kind of like a thick rubbery plasticky material which i like and its like hollow on the inside and it bounces in different directions and i dont really know i never played with anything like this as like a kid very much ive like seen em around but i think the fact that it like bounces in opposite directions made me not want to play with it because it meant i couldnt control it but that says a lot about me but no yeah different colors like its fun you can squeeze it i dont know if it like moves or not im trying to like manipulate it but i dont think it does that so that is what i have to say about this guy this 206 is like that things cousin it kind of like looks like the same thing except instead of like having pointy edges its rounded but its still kind of like a star or like a flower shape i feel like i like this one better because its like smoother and i feel like its a pretty shape and it has like the same colors like orange yellow pink purple green blue i think thats it but yeah i like this its also hollow in the middle never really like played with anything like this as a kid these two 205 206 kind of like look similar in my mind like they have the same vibes yeah its kind of all i have to really say lets see yeah ok this 208  has like a dent in it is it supposed to have a dent in it ok for the purposeok anyway i shouldnt ask that ok i like this one 208 i had a lot of these as a kid because my mom was obsessed with everything being a learning opportunity and not just letting me have fun so i definitely like this i think you can play with it but you can also like learn from it i also think of fun game is to actually like be like where is like a certain country like thats fun for me or continent or whatever its like squishy so it could also be like a stress ball type thing but also like you know catching throws into the air and catches its like very very light im actually not good at guai feel like this is heavier but this is like super light like very foamy like very colorful but like it has like the whole like globe on it which is cool like separated by different colors which makes it easy and theyre all like labeled too so yeah my instinct is to squeeze it like this or to like toss it around in my hands like this this thing 207 this is weird like this like looks like stuff ive played with before but its like not like its veryit feels like hay or something its like little rubber tendrils and its green and yellow and like its fun to like fidget with but i dont think i would like play with this like if i were a kid i wouldnt wanna like play catch with it well maybe i would like maybe its actually kind of fun i dont know but its like an interesting textureon my hands kind of like almost like tussling through like really coarse hair or something like that so oh theres actually hairs inside of it someones hair must have gotten it but yeah thats what i have to say about these balls more objects should i not touch it yet oh my god i love this thing 211 like i wanna take this home but i know i cant because its for like science but this is my favorite of all of them and its kind of fun you can like stick your finger in it and just like move the liquid around and like the little shapes inside there are like 3 dolphins and its supposed to be like the ocean but this is definitely fun definitely very different than like any of the other objects here i dont even know what this 212 is is it like a bead am i allowed toknow this looks like aok this 212 looks like a bead thats all im really getting from it um this is not you know its cute but its not like giving its not giving this 211 i love because its like squishy and malleable and i think what attracts me to this 211 is like the risk the fact that it could break like the fact that it could potentially get liquid all over me and like i can stick my finger through and its like very fun like this is the most fun to play with ill put down this 210 is like another type like stress ball type thing but its cool that shaped like a brain and it has like a nice kind of like texture has like a nice shape where you can just sit it somewhere and it has this like branding on it so this is obviously used for some sort of capitalistic gain and then this 209 is cute as well like its like a little body so its shaped very differently than like the other things youre not you know you could squeeze it but i feel like im not meant to squeeze it its green and it has like alien eyes and you can like kind of bend its legs well maybe you can bend them a lot you can kind of bend them a lot actually unless im just like really strong theyre not supposed to do that but its kind of like an alien gumby so i like that like how you can bend it theyre all different colors so this 212 is red this 211 is blue this 210 is purple this 209 is green um but yeah i really like this one 211 in case its not obvious so yeah is there anything else i should sayok goodbye objectswhoa and i can open them or no i cant open them why did you do thati like these 213216 this 213 feels like it has beans in it this 215 thisfeels like it maybe has like dried peas in it or something but i dont know if thats really possible i dont know how peas dry this 216 ok so this definitely feels like sand like a fine sand not like super fine but like definitely like a fine sand and then this 214 i would almost also say is like a sand but maybe like a little more coarse and theyre all 213216 in these different bags which like this 213 is like theyre 213216 like very silky i guess this one 215like this one 213 its kind of easier to feel whats in it than this one 215 because this one 215 has like a lot of texture on it and this one 213 like is sort of silkier and smoother so i can kind of like feel around that way um like kind of same yeah honestly like kind of same with this one 214 216 like honestly its also different because like this 216 has more what i believe to be sand in it than this one 214 does wait maybe thats the whole point maybe maybe there are two sets holding 213 with 215 and 214 with 216 of the same thing and one just has less in it why am i trying tolikeyou know but no anyway its possible maybe these holding 213 are like little rocks or something i dont know but yeah theyre fun to play with i prefer kind of playing with this one 213 than i do with this one 216 because this one 213 i can like move them around more and this one 216 im just kind of like squishing in the sand yeah i definitely like this one 213 but itsyeah theres something in there something going on so yeah theyre 213216 pretty colors too like the bags themselves have these like nice little designs theyre like coin purses which i like but theyre like filled with different things and i feel likei feel like if i knew how to juggle i would juggle these right now like thats kind of the vibe im getting but i dont know how to juggle so i wont try unless it would make your research more interesting but yeah that is what i feel about these 213216 so ok felt 217 this is what i would like make halloween costumes out of as a child because its very like user friendly and you can like glue itbut its like not like the most comfortable material i feel like a lot of people dont really wear like felt like i wouldnt really wear like a felt thing unless i were like a child who needed to but its red and its like felt and its like relatively soft so there is that then there is this 218 which kind of feels like a bed sheet material to me um like kind of comfortable but like not the most comfortable maybe also like kind of like a shirtif i knew more about like different types of fabric i could probably try to guess what it was maybe like cotton maybe like something i dont know its also like more flexible like you can scrunch it up better thanscrunches up 217 and 218 well i just made it 217 wrinkly but like you can kind of scrunch it 218 up really small and that one 217  you kind of cant this 218 is like a darker maroon color this 219 ooh this is what i would actually want to have my sheets be made of because this feels like somehow like softer and like more comfortable than this one 218 does and has like a little designs on it not on the other side but yeah its like soft its like again like very flexible but it just like feels softer than this one so like these 218 219 are similar but like this one 219 is better feeling like to the touch and then this 220 is like lace which like cute but yeah its got like some mesh going on and then some like like embroidery or like whatever happening so its white and its like kind of stretchy actually quite stretchy at least compared to like this 219 is not very stretchy but this 220 is stretchy probably because of like the maybe the mesh material or like what its made of yeah theyre all 217220 fabrics fabricky this 217 one again like this one 217 you couldntlike you could bunch it up but its just is a lot thicker so so theres that that is that oh uh ah ok so this 224 is some sort of like canvas like burlapy material my grandmother was like really poor and they actually made dresses out of like flour sacks or whatever which i think was like a really common thing for people to do i mean you know the dust bowl that and then so like this 224 is like not super stretchy um i dont know i feel like my first instinct with this is not like clothing its like something else like maybe like a bag or like like when youre like casting like a fossil you like use burlap and then it like adheres to the the plaster that youre using cause its like because this is flexible but still kind of like strong and like doesnt break super easily just because of like its weaving i guess so its like very strong but i wouldnt say its like the most comfortable like i wouldnt want to wear it you knowbut thats not always the function of like fabrics this 223 is like kind of like faux fur vibe im feeling um i enjoy it this would be a good rug i actually have a rug that was veryhad a rug that was very similar to this and it kind of feels like a dog or like if someone has like super soft hair and i think its probably made out of like that like plasticky material like i dont sense that its like real hair it has this like backing to it whichi dont know which kind of like shows that its not real maybe because it would be like leathery what else its black its dark you can kind of like manipulate it and like move it around like could brush it all in one direction or all in the other direction or in like different directions and kind of play with it which is like what i liked to do when i had a rug like this i would just like sit there like this but yeah its very soft very comfortable again probably wouldnt like wear it just because like it could also like get little bits stuck in it yeah definitely has that vibe like theres like this little piece of dust here but yeah this is this is pleasant this 222 this is like really soft like i wouldoohi would wear like some sort of like jacket with this as the lining in like winter ooh and its like stretchy too so yeah this is very fluffy kind of like the like sherpa sherpa feeling its very nice its also like very soft on the other side and its like stretchy and comfy and like i would use it as like a blanket in the winter or like some sort of like like i said like a lining to a jacket its like nice and white and it kind of reminds me of like sheeps wool even though i dont think thats what it is but it like reminds me of it or like maybe it is i dont know im not very good but its likei like this its like one of my favorites thus far and then this 221 is velvet this is like reminds me of like a halloween costume like someone whos going to be a vampire would maybe use this to like make a cape for themself and its also like kind of stretchy and elasticky its like crushed velvet so has this kind of like textured look um which like it is texturedbut like the coloring is like kind of like fluid and its not like one color and it has like darker spots and it has lighter spots and it kind of like hits the light in a very interesting way i feel like like the color can kind of like change depending on how you scrunch it and things like that so it like looks kind of dark here but then you like spread it out and its light so i dont know the science behind that but like the light is hitting it at different angles which does a lot more to it than like say this thing 222 which just kind of like looks the same this 221 almost looks like a like a liquid almost to me when im like moving it around its also like very soft and like nice to touch but because its like crushed velvet like like its soft to touch but you cant like run your hand over it like it kind of gets like some backlash whereas like this 223 its like that or like that 222 so so yeah that is what i have to say about these items like an observationnot really i want to touch this 211 more though i dont have anything to say about it but but yeah i enjoy it let me think trying to think of more content for you yeah i dont know i mean like the objects change from like being like balls like being things that you play with to like just like being like more like tactile maybe things so that was kind of cool to play with these toys but yeah hopefully i described them enough for youso that is what i have to say thank you thank thank you science', 'sentence-tokens': ['Ok is my bag and stuff

think you can play with it but you can also like learn from it.', 'I also think of fun game is to actually like be like where is like a certain country like thats fun for me or continent or whatever its like squishy so it could also be like a stress ball type thing but also like you know catching throws into the air and catches its like very very light.', 'Im actually not good at guai feel like this is heavier but this is like super light like very foamy like very colorful but like it has like the whole like globe on it which is cool like separated by different colors which makes it easy and

with before but its like not like its veryit feels like hay or something.', 'its like little rubber tendrils and its green and yellow and like its fun to like fidget with but I dont think I would like

like giving.', 'its not giving this 211.', 'I love because its like squishy and malleable and I think what attracts me to this 211 is like the risk.', 'the fact that it could break, like the fact that it could potentially get liquid all over me and like I can stick my finger through.', 'and its like very fun.', 'like this is the most fun to play with.', 'Ill put down.', 'This 210 is like another type like stress ball type thing but its cool that shaped like a brain and it has like a nice kind of like texture, has like a nice shape where you can just sit it somewhere and it has this like branding on it.', 'so this is obviously used for some sort of capitalistic gain.', 'and then this 209 is cute as well.', 'Like its like a little body so its shaped very differently than like the other things youre not.', 'You know you could squeeze it, but I feel like Im not meant to squeeze it.', 'Its green and it has like alien eyes and you can like kind of bend its legs.', 'well maybe you can

can bend it.', 'theyre all different colors.', 'so this 212 is red.', 'This 211 is blue.', 'This 210 is purple.', 'This 209 is green.', 'Um but yeah I really like this one 211 in case its not

one 215 because this one 215 has like a lot of texture on it and this one 213 like is sort of silkier and smoother so I can kind of like feel around that way.', 'um like kind of same.', 'Yeah, honestly like kind of same with this one 214 216.', 'Like honestly its also different because like this 216 has more what I believe to be sand in it than this one 214 does.', 'Wait, maybe thats the whole point.', 'Maybe maybe there are two sets holding 213 with 215 and 214 with 216 of the same thing and one just has less in it.', 'Why am I trying tolikeyou know?', 'But no.', 'Anyway, its possible maybe these holding 213 are like little rocks or something.', 'I dont know.', 'but yeah theyre fun to play with.', 'I prefer kind of playing with this one 213 than I do with this one 216 because this one 213 I can like move them around more and this one 216.', 'Im just kind of like squishing in the sand.', 'Yeah, I definitely like this one 213 but itsyeah theres something in there, something going on.', 'So yeah, theyre 213216.', 'Pretty colors too.', 'Like the bags themselves have these like nice little designs.', 'Theyre like coin purses which I like, but theyre like filled with different things and I feel likei feel like if I knew how to juggle I would juggle these right now.', 'like thats kind of the vibe Im getting.', 'but I dont know how to juggle so I wont try unless it would make your research more interesting.', 'But yeah, that is what I feel about these.', '213216 So ok Felt 217 This is what I would like make Halloween costumes out of as a child because its very like user friendly and you can like glue itbut its like not like the most comfortable material.', 'I feel like a lot of people dont really wear like felt like I wouldnt really wear like a felt thing unless I were like a child who needed to.', 'but its red and its like felt and its like relatively soft so there is that.', 'Then there is this 218 which kind of feels like a bed sheet material to me.', 'um like kind of comfortable but like not the most comfortable.', 'maybe also like kind of like a shirtif I knew more about like different types of fabric I could probably try to guess what it was.', 'Maybe like cotton, maybe like something I dont know.', 'Its also like more flexible, like you can scrunch it up better thanscrunches up 217 and 218.', 'Well I just made it 217.',

soft its like again like very flexible but it just like feels softer than this one.', 'So like these 218 219 are similar but like this one 219 is better feeling like to the touch and then this 220 is like lace which like cute but yeah its got like some mesh going on and then some like like embroidery or like whatever happening.', 'So its white and its like kind of stretchy.', 'actually quite stretchy at least compared to like this 219 is not very stretchy but this 220 is stretchy probably because of like the maybe the mesh material or like what its made of.', 'Yeah theyre all 217220 fabrics fabricky This 217 one again like this one 217 you couldntlike you could bunch it up but its just is a lot thicker so so theres that That is that.', 'Oh uh ah Ok so this 224 is some sort of like canvas like burlapy material.', 'My grandmother was like really poor and they actually made dresses out of like flour sacks or whatever which I think was like a really common thing for people to do.', 'I mean you know the dust bowl, that and then so like this 224 is like not super stretchy.', 'um I dont know.', 'I feel like my first instinct with this is not like clothing, its like something else like maybe like a bag or like like when youre like casting like a fossil.', 'you like use burlap and then it like adheres to the the plaster that youre using cause its like because this is flexible but still kind of like strong and like doesnt break super easily just because of like its weaving I guess.', 'So its like very strong but I wouldnt say its like the most comfortable like I wouldnt want to wear it you knowbut thats not always the function of like fabrics.', 'this 223 is like kind of like faux fur vibe.', 'Im feeling.', 'um I enjoy it.', 'This would be a good rug.', 'I actually have a rug that was veryhad a rug that was very similar to this and it kind of feels like a dog or like if someone has like super soft hair and I think its probably made out of like that like plasticky material.', 'Like I dont sense that its like real hair.', 'it has this like backing to it whichi dont know which kind of like shows that its not real.', 'maybe because it would be like leathery, what else?', 'its black, its dark, you can kind of like manipulate it and like move it around.', 'like could brush it all in one direction or all in the other direction or in like different directions and kind of play with it.', 'which is like what I liked to do when I had a rug like this.', 'I would just like sit there like this.', 'but yeah its very soft, very comfortable.', 'Again probably wouldnt like wear it just because.', 'like it could also like get little bits stuck in it.', 'Yeah definitely has that vibe like theres like this little piece of dust here.', 'but yeah this is.', 'this is pleasant this 222. this is like really soft like I wouldoohi would wear like some sort of like jacket with this as the lining in like winter.', 'Ooh and its like stretchy too.', 'So yeah this is very fluffy.', 'kind of like the like sherpa sherpa feeling.', 'Its very nice.', 'Its also like very soft on the other side and its like stretchy and comfy and like I would use it as like

like oh i dont know i guess this may be justthis is justall right this 201 almost reminds me of like a sea urchin and i guess i like the ocean and like yeah i guess i like this because sea urchinsi dont know whathow to describe this 204 i guess i like the colors um it like feels almost like a stress ball which is nice um yeah i dont know if i have any more thoughts ok right off the bat i think this 207i used to have a lot of stuff like this and i really enjoyed this kind of stuff so i like this 207 um i guess ithis one 208 also i really like because im terrible at geography but i enjoy world maps and maps of any kind so i enjoy these 208 i think like like it brings back memories because like we used to have like globes in the house so like whenever i was free just like spinning the globe figuring out like like pointing your finger at something being like oh thats where that isyeah i think these two 205 206 are very similar ive definitely seen these 205 206 a lot as the kid but i think i gravitated to more of these 207 and like these 207 would also come in like lightlike itd be like the same texture not the ball form but like you could like turn it on and thered be like light at the end of it and it was pretty coolyeah i dont know what elsei like this set 205208 more than that set 201204 this is more fun and colorful so i guess theres that im gonna go back to the not liking pink but thats alright um yeah i dont know what else i can say about thoseok this one 206 i guess is more like flowery like each shape is i guessi guess is more of a starbut i think it is um it is preferable to this one 205 which is like star shaped like almost like the cowboy starsbut like the sheriff things like in the cowboy movies that was not a great description but yeah ohm i have no idea how to begin explaining this one 208 but its definitely a nice stress reliever just like playing with this one i guess its foam yeah yeah i dont know what elseright great ok ok yeah i love these 211 just like i love them i guess explanation um it would be like i think like a jellylike andright i feel like i say mesmerizing for this because i literally could play with this all day and not get bored so theres that 210 i collect foam brainsits my neuroscience obsession but no i love these 210 and theyre squishy and nice as collectables um i guess it 212 is hard red heartshaped a bead of some sort which is kind of cute so um its 209 an alien which i saw nope yesterday so so already i do not like aliens so that movie has scarred me so yeah i think i i like this one 211 the most of out of all these even with my foam brain obsession i like this morei think its just like interesting to play with theres likeits versatile you can do whatever you want with it and then also like theres it doesnt always have to have like dolphins in it like it has a bunch of stuff yeah its like squishy and bluefavorite color so thats nice yeahthank you thank you these 213216 are very pretty um ok theyre all filled with different things so thats cool i would say like this one 213 feels like beans or something and this one 216 seems like more finer grains this 215 is like in between and this one 214 feels like sand so that is the order if i were to order them i guess i like these two 215 216 a lot because it reminds me a lot of like henna like the designs that i would typically do for henna so i like these two these 213 214 are actually really cool too man im not very good at describing things i guess the butterflies on them 213 214 i feel like if they were in real life theyd be really huge and i dont know if im a fan of that so i dont like these 213 214 as much as these two 215 216 yeah yeah i mean theyre like theyrei think these 213 214 are softer than this one 215 because the embroidery but yesalrighty i guess just by texture like these two 218 219 feel very similar this one 217 obviously felt so it is a lot softer i guess than these two 218 219 and lace 220 i think is just a different category in and of itself so theres that i think this 220 is very pretty its very flowery which is nice i dont know if im a fan of this print 219 but i like the gold in it its very shinyso theres that and i think i also like this 220 because its shiny so this one 218 seems a little boring because its not as shinyand i feel like the felt 217 is like an in between because it has texture to it so thats nice i guess if i were to like make something out of them i think these two 218 219 would go well together with like the gold and the maroonish purplish color yeah i dont know if the felt 217 matches with this 218 219 220 the rest of themi think its just like these 218 219 220 are like i feel like very like softer or likei wouldnt say paler but more muted than this and this is just like a bright red feltso yeah so i would group like these three 218 219 220 together and like these two 218 219 specifically and then these two 217 220 are kind of just in their own world oh i guess i like the fraying 218 because with i always have to be like doing something yeah yeah so fraying really gets meyes yeah yeah and i think that 218 fraying is more apparent than this one 219 so i like that one 218yeah ok alrightalready i love the velvet 221 i like thei like how like itthe colors change with like how the light hits it and i love like red velvets in general so this is cute i think after that this 222 may be second because of the texture its very soft like an animal would be yes ive always hated stuff like this 223 because a i feel like it gets everywhere and its just likei knowits not realhairlike but its also just like its not synthetic so its like an inbetween which is weird this one 224 is not as interesting as the others kind of coarse but i think its preferable to this 223 so yeah if i were to rank them um i guess yeah i really like this one 222 ithe one thing i dont like about this is that like its white so you can see all of the like other fabrics that have gotten onto it whereas this one 221 even though theres like parts of this 222 on here 221 its not as noticeable as if it were to be on the white or the black 223 umm this 223 also makes me think of like rock and like rock bandsyeah with like the long hair and like the yeah um and this 221 i guess feels more like royalty which is maybe why i like it cause it feels very regali think yeah and this one 222 just feels like a cozy day at home with like a mug of hot chocolate and a book so yes i dont know what to make of this 224 so there are no like associations i justof course it feels like it should go underneath like if you were to make something out of it i feel like it would go underneath one of these to give it like structure but yeah i dont think this 224 would be very appealing on someone compared to those fabrics 217220 though i think these are more interestingi guess i feel like theres like a progressionwith like i guess i wouldnt say impractical but like i feel like these 221224 are more like you use them or like you see them more in your daily life um and its like from these things 201212 i guess youd have in your childhood or like you see once and

and of itself.', 'So theres that.', 'I think this 220 is very pretty.', 'Its very flowery, which is nice.', 'I dont know if Im a fan of this print 219, but I like the gold in it.', 'Its very shinyso theres that.', 'And I think I also like this 220 because its shiny.', 'So this one 218 seems a little boring because its not as shinyand I feel like the felt 217 is like an in between because it has texture to it so thats nice.', 'I guess if I were to like make something out of them, I think these two 218 219 would go well together with like the gold and the maroonish purplish color Yeah, I dont know if the Felt 217 matches with this 218 219 220.', 'The rest of themi think its just like these 218 219 220 are like I feel like very like softer or likei wouldnt say paler but more muted than this and this is just like a bright red feltso yeah so I would group like these three 218 219 220 together and like these two 218 219 specifically.', 'and then these two 217 220 are kind of just in their own world.', 'Oh I guess I like the fraying 218 because with I always have to be like doing something.', 'Yeah yeah so fraying really gets meyes yeah yeah and I think that 218 fraying is more apparent than this one 219 so I like that one 218yeah Ok alrightalready I love the Velvet 221.', 'I like thei like how like itthe colors change with like how the light hits it and I love like red velvets in general so this is cute.', 'I think after that this 222 may be second because of the texture.', 'its very soft like an animal would be.', 'Yes, Ive always hated stuff like this 223 because a I feel like it gets everywhere and its just likei knowits not realhairlike but its also just like its not synthetic so its like an inbetween which is weird.', 'This one 224 is not as interesting as the others kind of coarse, but I think its preferable to this 223.', 'So yeah, if I were to rank them um I guess yeah I really like this one 222 ithe one thing I dont like about this is that like its white so you can see all of the like other fabrics that have gotten onto it whereas this one 221 even though theres like parts of this 222 on here 221 its not as noticeable as if it were to be on the white or the black 223. umm this 223 also makes me think of like rock and like rock bandsyeah with like the long hair and like the yeah um and this 221 I guess feels more like royalty which is maybe why I like it cause it feels very regali think yeah and this one 222 just feels like a cozy day at home with like a mug of hot chocolate and a book.', 'So yes I dont know what to make of this 224 so there are no like associations.', 'I justof course it feels like it should go underneath like if you were to make something out of it I feel like it would go underneath one of these to give it like structure.', 'but yeah I dont think this 224 would be very appealing on someone compared to those fabrics 217220 though I think these are more interestingi guess I feel like theres like a progressionwith like I guess I wouldnt say impractical but like I feel like these 221224 are more like you use them or like you see them more in your daily life.', 'Um and its like from these things 201212 I guess youd have in your childhood or like you see once and then you dont really use it again to a purse 213216 which you use more often and then fabrics 217224 which are like very versatile you see and everything.']}, '107': {'statements': 'oki dont think so theyre 201204 all round of some kind this 202 is a pink ball that is spherical this 201 is a sphere that has spikes on it its rubbery it is malleable this 204 feels like fabric feels like it has sand in it of some kind and this 203 is also spherelike but it has like such suction cups that kind of go around and make it like a double sphere this 202 feels like a handball it does say high bounce and it does bounce um oh nice this 201 is interesting not what i was expecting i like the lights kind of reminds me of police lights though this 204 kind of reminds me of juggling balls that i have seen but i dont knowit feels like it can be easily thrown around and this 203 i suppose it does seem to stick pretty well i dont know if this can stick to like a ceiling or wall but its still squishy none of them 201204 are really like too solid theyre all malleable at least by hand and i guess this 202 pink one is the biggest and this 203 small suction ball one is the smallest this is them in like order of size i would say theyre all rollable to some extent the one 204 that is fabric with probably sand of some kind is the least rollable and i think thats around it ok more spherical objects 205208 this globe one 208 isoh its squishyit feels like a stress ball i guess its most similar to the pink one 202 because it is like a solid sphere while these 205 206these look like childrens toys to me either that or dogs toys they are also squishy i feel like if i were a dog i would have fun chewing on this this one 207its still like round and spherical but its not like a ball the center i guessi guess its like a bunch of like rubber strings that have all been attached to the center and you can kind of see like where it wraps around because theres like some strings that go down and some strings that go up and theres like sparse strings around this kind of center here it doesnt really roll the globe 208 does roll both of these toys 205 206 also roll and i guess these 205 206 are very multi colored i dont know this 207 is green and yellow this 208 is a globe very blue lots of colors for different countries and yeah all 205208 very squishable ok these 109112 are less spherical whoa this 211 is very interesting this is very fun to play with its like a cylindrical thing filled with fluid i see there sharksor noits dolphins in it it seems to be one like contained thing but then youre able to kind of manipulate it so that it rolls around in itself and im assuming that through the center theres like oneyeahone long thing i can kind of bring my finger all the way through it um this is very nice to play with this 210 i think is a stress ball stress ball in the shape of a brain its purple ive seen stuff like this kind of given out at neuroscience conventionsyeah they are fun to play with im assuming its made out of some kind of foam and it has words in it druthers title company llc and i guess identifying numbers this i guess is the most spherical of the objects here 209212 but it is still not like a sphere its in the shape ofwell its kind of in the shape of a brain theres 209 a little alien toy im assuming its a toy it has little holes in the back of it and its limbs are slightly manipulatable but i dont wanna break it so i dont wanna like move it around too much ok sooh ok so its manipulatable in that if i move its limbs around they will stay in the same position that ive kind of put them in which is cool can kind of make him sit down maybe i dont know if hes gonna be able to sit down on his own but i dont know it reminds me of one of those like model wooden things that you can get at ikea where you can pose them and then you can like use it for drawing references yeah except this a little green alien i dont know hes got four fingers it looks like or three and a thumb on each hand and his head is very solid and this last thing 212 it is in the shape of a heart it is red it feels very solid and it makes quite a sound on the table so im assuming its some kind of either hard plastic or like marble type thing or glass it has kind of little waves in it and i can see something inside its kind of like a sparkly red thing but im not sure if its red because it might just be the light going through the outer layer which is red and its not that heavy but it does have like a little bit of a weight to it yeah this 211 is my favorite ok so these are 213216 all i would say the most similar of the sets they 213216 all are i think coin purses of some kind theyre in the same shape they have the same um kind of like format of a fabric with metal clasp and im assuming im not supposed to open them because they have rubber bands around the clasps um they are different colors so theres like a yellow gold one 216 blue red and gold one 215 the black one 214 with butterflies on it and a red one 213 with butterflies on it but they all 213216 seem to hold different things um the one that looks the fullest is the red pink one 213 i guess from order would be red pink 213 and then the yellow one 216 the blue one 215 and then the black one 214 but then from feeling it this one 213 feels like it has like little balls in it they arent metal balls i dont think but they arent likethey arent like styrofoam or anything theyre not very squishable they hold their shape um this yellow one 216 feels like it has sand of some kind or like very fine grains of something um lets see this one 215 feels like it has the same thing as this pink one 213 except less of it um so its like less full but i think its the same thing thats filled with and then this one 214 i dont know if im deducing too much but im assuming that it also has the same feeling as this yellow one 216 but also less of it they all 213216 seem to be made from the same people or same company because theyre all pretty uniform and i guess the designsthe red one 213 and the black one 214 have the same kind of butterfly design and the yellow one 216 and the blue one 215 have the same kind of swirling design just different colors ok so these are all 217220 like rectangle squareish pieces of fabric um two of them 219 220 are light colored i would say like creamish white like light gray and like two of them 217 218one of them 217 is red and one of them 218 is maroonish colored so darker this red one 217 feels like felt to me its not that stretchable and it does fold a little bit but it doesnt really hold those folds um this white one 220 it is stretchable i think its probably because its lacelike in the lattice theres like a flower design and then theres like lace between that holds it together the flower part isnt that stretchable but then the lace is its pretty light um this 219 feels like a regular piece of fabric i dont know how i would classify this its not that stretchable it feels like something that i would see like on an apron or a tablecloth there is a seam at the bottom so its its clearly been cut out of something im pretty sure that all of these 217220 have been cut out of something but this one 219 is kind ofyou can see that its part of something bigger because theres one side that has like a white seam with little green stitches on the bottom this maroon 218 one also very fabriclike a little bit more stretchable the seams at the end are kind of frayed so also suggests that its been cut out of something but all of the sides i guess except for this side at the bottom here seem to be pretty identical so its probably been cut around like this like this one 219 i cant tell for the felt one this seems like its been cut all around kind of the same and for this one 220 i think probably the bottom edge would be this because theres less design and then the design kind of ends here with these little waves so another one thats cut like this um this one 218 feels like something i might see in like a very thin window curtain of some kind i feel like i wouldnt see any of these 217220 in clothing though they are fabric maybe except for this one 220 in like the last layer of a dress or something because they dont really seem that stretchy or comfortable to wear yeah ok i like these 221224 better than the previous ones 217220 theyre a lot more i dont know tactile theres two black ones 223 224 one i guess like light maroon red one 221 and then one 222 that is cream colored or white tannish this first one 224 it is kind of stretchy it looks like its made out of some kind of wovenwoven fiber and once again has like a seam and looks like its been cut around four sides its kind of rough it reminds me of like a tarp of some kind or like the material that you would use for like rice sacks or like potato sacks this one 221 its double sided so one side is very smooth and fabriclike and it feels like theres like two layers feels like two things that have been kind of mended together and the other side im pretty sure is velvet if i move my hand along one way its very smooth and if i move it along the other way its kind of rough and not as pleasant and then like side to side its kind of in between obviously neutral once again theres a seam at the bottom and it looks like its been cut around i dont know velvet is used for clothing so i can definitely see this being used in like a dress or something i had a dress that is like this except blue umm and i dont know i really like velvet this 222 feels likeit feels very soft it reminds me of like sheeps wool but its obviously not like raw sheeps wool its been processed and then on one side theres like a lattice in which you can see how its been kind of put together notim assuming this 224 is part of this 224and the other side 222 i guess is meant to mimic the like wool or the fur of some animal im assuming a sheep or like a lamb or a llama or something it feels very warm i feel like i would not want to wear this today because its very hot today but maybe in the winter i would appreciate having a coat made out of something like this and this 223 last one islets seeits also double sided all of them 221224 are double sided except for this tarp 224 one it seems this one 223 has like faux fur im assuming this does not feel likefeel or look like real fur and it feels like the kind of thing that i would see in like a theater costume for a play or like some kind of mascot costume one side very flat this looks like it would be like the inside of whatever this would be covering and then this is obviously the more decorative side with the fur it all kind of goes one way and if you brush it the other way like it kind of stands up it kind of reminds me of i think his name is sully from monsters except hes like bluish and this is obviously like black i guess on the sidesi mean looking at the back of it or what i assume is the back there is once more like a seam along the bottom and then a cut here but then the way that the fur like moves suggests that it moves this way and so like the top and the bottom would be this and this and this would be the side so i think like it was probably a larger piece of fabric and this is cut out of the side of it at the bottom or what i what im classifying as the bottom there is kind of halfway through theres been a cut in the fur cause theres one half that the fur kind of goes down and then the other half it looks like kind of a bad haircut the first is like very short at this end but then otherwise its pretty uniform throughout and can like smooth it in the direction that it goes and it gets pretty flat yeah well in the order of how things were taken out these 201204 were the first ones they are the most spherical i would say and then these ones 205208 theyre also like balllike theyre toylike both of these sets 201208 are things that i would play with this next set 209212 was a little bit surprising to see it is also toys i i really like this thing 211 its like its very slippery like kind of wants to get out of my hand and i dont know its like a fidget toy and i love fidget toys uh so these are probably the most irregular shapes out of all of these especially this little alien guy 209 the next set 213216 i feel is the most similar out of all four of them 201216 as in similar to each other and that theyre all like little coin purses with clasps that are holding something with two of them that feel like they have the same material two of them feel like they have the same but a different material than the previous two and then they all have like different amounts of that material and then the last two sets 217224 are both like fabric types that i would see in like i dont know my elementary school art class wherewhere we would be like sewing things together and figuring out how like mending things works and theyre 201224 all very tactile i think theyre nice to touch i i love this 211', 'sentence-tokens': ['Oki dont think so.', 'Theyre 201204 all round of some kind.', 'This 202 is a pink ball that is

bad at these and its yellow and green and red and black and its not bouncy and i know that you use it to just go like that its semisquishy but its more like soft and its fabricky and theres beads on the inside that i can kind of feel yeah this 202 ones the biggest and then this 201 one and then this one 204 and this one 203 thats itthis is like sensory overload ok so this one 205 is bouncy and its madeup of a lot of stars that are just gelled together its pink and purple and yellow and green and blue and orange and its very rubbery i realized ive used rubbery for like every single one but thats ok its slightly bendy i wouldnt call it likeits kind of squishy but its just more like bendy like the individual stars are bendy and its like translucent colored and then so is this one 206 this one is a bunch of rounded stars or like flowers i guess so its not as like spiky like this one 205 has little circles on the ends but its kind of spiky and this ones 206 more round and spherelike and itsyeah its a bunch of flowers just interwoven its also kind of bouncy and its also kind of squishy bendy and its also translucent and theres nothing at the center same with this one 205 theres kind of just a gap and then this one 208 i used to have this one as a kid it is very squishy and it makes a sound when you squish it and it shows the world and its blue and all the countries are different rainbow colors its semibouncy and theres a little tiny like divot here i dont know if thats supposed to be there or if its just been loved too much and yeah and then this one 207 is just a bunch of small little like strands that are bouncy stretchy it is not bouncy you just throw it and it does nothing but i like it because you can take you can take some strands you can go like that and it moves and the strands are easily movable theyre very mobile i guess and bendy and you can squish it if you want to and its yellow and green which is kind of like interspersed throughout the whole thing like theres little spots of green spots of yellow and yeahok i like this one 211 ok so this has dolphinswhoawhat the heckit has dolphins and if you pick it up this part kind of moves and so its very hard to actually hold in your hand or else like itll just slide out of your hand because it moves whoa ok yeah this is tricky i really like this one its its squishy and theres some sort of gel on the inside with sparkles and three dolphins that are blue and white with black and white eyes and it was apparently made in ningbo china which is kind of cool and it bounces a little bit its very squishy i like that one this one 210 is a stress ball or stress brain and its from druthers its purple and its squishytheres an inside thats easily like condensed so you can squish it yeah and then it is of the brain so theres little divots like the brain has and then this one 212 definitely not bouncy its very hard and red and theres like a shiny core on the inside i dont know whats up with that andoh its a bead so you can put like a string through it and its a heart and theres like like stripes on the outside thats kind of cool its like marbley and its small and then this 209 is a alien man he is easily bendable so you can bend his arms and his legs however you please hes green and he has black eyes and a black mouth and yeah you can bend his legs and arms in any direction he can do the splits he is not squishy hes very hard he has four fingers and three toes i guess so variety we love it and hes pretty small you cant move his neck and you cant like bend his body but yeah yeah i like the dolphin one 211 ok so its four purses am i allowed to open themshould i not open themok yes so this one 214 has butterflies on it its black and it has butterflies one of them is gold and silver one of those purple and gold and silver one of them is gold and silver gold and silver gold and silver and then there are a few on the other side that are pink and silver gold and silver theres like one two three four five six butterflies on this side or at least like parts of butterflies and then on this side theres one two three four five and it has a black background and its very silky and it has silver clasp opening thing and thennever mind theres seven on this side and then this one 215 has a blue background with like a yellow pink silver swirly pattern and the pink is kind of like embellishing a lot of what like the yellow and silver theres a lot of yellow and the pattern is the same on both sides but slightly moved around so its the same kind of gist but like not identical also silver clasp and this one 213 is red and silky and it has butterflies again these are pink and blue and gold and silver theres one two three four butterflies on this side and then one two three four five six butterflies on this side but two of them overlap onto both sides and it has a red background and all the butterflies are pink and gold and silver theres no like color variation except for this one thats blue yeah and this one 216 looks the same as the other one 215 but it has a lime background and it is gold and silver yeah and it has its also similar pattern same pattern as this one 215 just different colors and yeah the gold is very sparkly just like the other one like the silver and it also has this little clasp yeahok so this one 217 is a rectangle and its red um its like a softish fabric but not very soft and like prettylike pretty thick yeah this one 220 is like lace fishnetty i dont know its white and silver it has like a pattern embellished on it but the rest of it is kind of seethrough because itstheres big holes intentional holes and its also a rectangle and then this one 218 is thinner than the first one 217 its like maroon and its more fabricky the other one 217 was like i dont know softer this one is closer to a square i would say its a square um and its slightly smaller than this one 217 in terms of area oh well no theyre probably theyre probably about the sameits 218 bigger this one 218 is bigger and it has little threads here and then this one 219 is also pretty a pretty thin fabric and it has gold embellishments and gray and it has a white background and it is not see through and theres no pattern on this side its only on this side and its a square and then there is something here thats white with green dashes to mark one side i guess yeahnoi think iok this 223these all remind me of things that i own so this 223 is veryits like furry and its black it is a squareish yeah it has long long fur that can stick up if you go like that but it also can smooth down it looks like one of those like shag rugs that you get i actually have one from my dorm room but its gray umm so thats this one and then this 222 isoh and then it 223 it doesnt have fur on the other side its kind of rough on the other side and then this one 222 is white it doesnt have the fur on one side its still very soft though and then it has very like short puffs of furish i guess and it has a bit of like black hairs on it probably from this one 223 and its 222 also a square it reminds me of like those like sweaters that people have i actually have one that looks like this and yeah its very very soft its like fuzzy whereas this ones just like furry this 224 kind of looks like a doormat and its black its a square its slightly seethrough because its just a bunch of tiny squares and its very coarse like its more rough and theres one like little piece at the end thats kind of coming off or starting to and then theres another piece here thats starting to come off and then on the edge its not see through itsor like its barely see through its more woven together than here yeah and then this one 221 is very velvety and it makes a slightly different color if you go oneif you brush it one way then if you brush it the other way its red it has one lining on one side thats not velvety its more like silky smooth and its the same color and itsoh its like dark dark red on the other side its a square theres two little things coming off on this side it has some fuzzies on it from this one 222 and it is soft and velvety and reminds me of the dress that i have these all 221224 remind me of things that i have and its 221 slightly stretchy yeah its stretchy this one 224 is not stretchy this one 222 is stretchy this one 223 is not yeah amazingthe hacky sack

ones 202204 and probably my least favorite cause the spikes are like kind of a weird texture and stuff this one 204 looks like those things that you play that game where you like kick it to the other person and then so its softer cool colors this ones 202 a little bit harder pink bigger bouncier than the other ones 201 203 204 this ones 203 like looks like those ones you maybe its supposed to stick on something but it has multiple colors so that ones kind of cool i guess this one 203 is the smallest and then this ones 202 the biggest probably i like this one 204 the most because its softer it has like the more like beanbagy feel and just like a little bit more like comforting feeling yeah do i keep goingok i guess this one 202 has more like identification stuff on it because like the barcode and i guess like where its made and the manufacturing information so maybe this is like i guess the brand i guess is more identifiable this one 201 i feel like of them all probably this 202 pink one seems the most durable probably do the most with it because you can like throw it up a bunch of things and its not going to like tear cause like this 204 could tear like it could get stained easier and these ones 201 203 are kind of soft this ones 203 like i guess is not fully formed it could be probably break the spikes off a little bit easier is that enough detailsthis ones 207 like really interesting because its like it has like the little core but all the rest of like the ballish components are like individual i feel like this is like a good like one of those like sensory soothing like activities because you can kind of just like play with it more these ones 205 206 are like super similar probably like same brand or something and they have like that gummy texture thing like plasticky kind of likei dont know i personally dont like the feel of these two 205 206 as much as like this one 207 or like that other one 204 this one 208 is kind of cool because its like the map and stuff but the texture of it too is like feels kind of like almost like maybe it has foam or something and its kind of i dont know i feel like this one 208 will fall apart easier and its probably like less i dont know less you can like interact with it whereas this one 207 because its like not the full like solid circle i feel like this one would last the longest and like encourages interaction between a little and these 205 206 are just kind of like i feel like these are more like decoration so theres not as much to do with them and they seem like kind of weird to be like throwing or like they feel kind of weird at least to me to like touch for too long so i feel like these 205 206 would be like maybe like decoration and this 207 would be the one that you would probably like play with or like interact with the most because i feel like the most comfortable out of all of them yepi think this ones 211 my favorite just cause this feels like really interesting to push this part back and forth and with the dolphins and stuff and it feels like its interesting to also look at i feel like this ones very entertaining this one 209 is interesting i guess like this group of four 209212 like diverges most from those 201208 because those 201208 are like balls and these 209212 are all just like randomor not random but like other objects that i dont know if i exactly see like the relation between like all these objects 209212 as much as the other ones 201208 the heart 212 is cool because its like red and it has like it looks like it has like not exactly a marbled color but theres like at least some difference not like solid solid red so looks like it like adds some more like depth or something in it this brain one 210 i guess is also i guess a cool one because its like foamy and you could probably like squeeze it but it probably would get like a bunch of cracks if you squeeze it too much maybe you cant do that maybe this ones also more like a decoration one then the alien 209 is interesting because it has all these like holes in the back of it so i dont know if maybe it was supposed to like have like a spike and you could like hang it up or something orbut this ones like not really its kind of solid so i guess its kind of like again i guess you could play like a toy maybe if you want a like alien toy but like again not something like some of the other ones 201208 where you could like use it as a stress ball or something like just to like do while youre like doing work or something you need something to feel and so yeah so the blue ones 211 definitely my favorite cause its kind of cool how you can like push your finger in and make the thing go other ways and then the dolphins are kind of cool as well and it has like sparkles in it as well which is also kind of nice these 213216 are cool because theyre like all i guess like the same like object just like different textiles and stuff but its cool that theyre all like the same these ones 213 214 probably came from like the same like maybe line because theyre both like they have really similar patterns of like moths this one 214 i think is moths yeah i think theyre both 213 214 moths and like they feel really smooth and you cant really feel the difference inthis one 213 you can kind of feel like if you running  your finger over it you kind of feel a difference where the embroidery is this one 214 you can also kind of feel a difference but i feel like its not as big a difference as this pink one 213 and then this one 213 has more stuff in it cause i feel like its more substantiali guess i cant really stand upbut it 213 feels like its more like substantial than this one 214 seems like its a little bit flimsyi guess theres just not as much stuff in it these ones 215 216 also i feel like are pretty similar because these ones you can definitely feel the differences in like the embroidery and stuff and you can feel like where theres like more sparkles or other stuff as well these ones 215 216 are also more colorful i feel like the 215 216 design is a little bit more aesthetically pleasing than the other ones 213 214 and probably this one 216 i think is my favorite because its like the bright yellow and it feels like i dont know really bright and like summery and stuff so probably this ones 216 my favorite this ones 214 probably my least favorite just because i dont know if i love the moths as much and its kind of like darker colors and not as bright and i guess its like summer i guess thats what im gravitating towardsbut yeah yeah theyre all 213216 like pretty much the same thing just like different designs and like how the textile feels is like what kind of like differentiates this one 220 kind of gives like wedding dress vibes i guess cause its like the lace and it looks like very like elegant and its like embellished so and its like really thin and like seethrough as well this one 217 feels like the felt stuff so probably like maybe for making i dont know puppets i guess if youre making like patches or something but this ones definitely more like playing every day and like the color toored is like more like an everydayish color well i guess white 220whites also everyday color but this is like a more like fancy this ones 219 probably like in between this is probably the next fanciest one because its not like seethrough but its still like white with like the gold kind of like shimmery lines in it as well but its feels more like regular everyday clothes fabric but just has nicer designs its probably the next fanciest one this 217 is the least fanciest one and then this one 218 i dont know what this is called but it 218 feels different than the other these two 217 219 like a little bit less soft and like cottony and its 218 like a burgundy so its again its like an everyday clothes like clothes like base of a clothe where i feel like this you wouldnt wear with a base of athis one 219 you could and then this 220 is just like a decoration on top of the clothes and then the burgundy 218i feel like this 217 is like a really really really bright red but the burgundy is more like subtle so i feel like this 218 could maybe also be dressed up in maybe like a fancy like semicasual outfit whereas this 217 i feel like you would have to wearor you dont have to you have to wear this in a casual setting because of the feltish but the color not so much but yeah in terms of like fanciness of wearing to events i feel like it would go this 220 to this 217 and these 217 220 are both cannot be on their own but these 218 219 could be on their ownnothis 224 is like really like rough and seethrough so i feel like this would have to be like fabric from like some sort of like household item or something you definitely could not wear it it kind of feels like potatosacky but like its black so maybei dont know what this came from but it doesnt have like a very like nice clothing feel to it this one 221 looks like kind of like this costume like king or queen robes they would have and so but like the velvet the velvet is nice like you could wear it in like the winter maybe at like a nice like christmas party or something like that i dont know but i dont know i personally dont really love the feel of velvet so i mean definitely more comfortable and pretty opposite to this one 224 this 224 is rough but i still dont really love this one 221 this ones 223 like ai guess this is like kind of is like a rug or i guess it could be like a shawl or like the lining of like those like really big winter coats that you buy this 223 ones also nice to just feel because its like really soft and likethe velvet 221i dont know this 223cause this 223 like has the stuff that like moves so i feel like its more fun to like go like the opposite directions in it so then i feel like its softer and like cooler this 222 is like that sherpaish stuff they make for like those like trucker jackets and like trucker hatsand so this ones 222 soft too this 222 is softer its 222 softer than this one 223 but i feel like you still 222 you dont have that fun like to go back and forth but this one 222 is definitely a lot softer and probably would be warmest i dont know maybe this 223 would be i dont know but these two 222 223 are probably like warmer thats like the exact opposite of that 224 cause its all like holey and seethrough but this one 222 i guess also like would get dirty easier like it shows like stuff up on it more so like these ones 221 223 224 are like a little bit more like they dont show like stuff that gets attached to it as much but yeah i guess in terms of like soft order this is like least soft 224 to most soft 222 and then in terms of what i feel like you could comfortably wear as clothes as a full outfit itd probably be this 221 to this 224 because i feel like you could have a whole outfit of this 222 but you could have a whole outfit of this 221 not a whole outfit of this 223 or that 224 no so i guess these 222 223 like kind of like these two 217 220 are like stuff that could be on top of something but couldnt be like your whole fabric for what youre wearing whereas this 221 could stand on its own and these colors 223 224 are like the same and then these ones 221 222 are different so its kind of nice to see them 221 222 next to each other not these two fabrics 221 222 going together but the colors are nicer because these 223 224 are just the same color umm i guess theyre notnot that it progressed exactly like this but it kind of felt like it progressed kind of like functionalitywise because we started out with balls that are kind of like more like things to play with or like decoration and stuff and then we ended with fabrics that are more like you could wear or like maybe on like your chairs or like household items so they seem more like functional and like you would use maybe longer because i guess like you would use like these 201212 more like as kids something like that but since these are like fabrics like these 217224 would be more of interest to older people those 201212 would be more of interest to younger people and then the purses 213216 were also kind of like in the middle too i guess this group 209212 was kind of a random group and that one kind of threw me because also thats not really as related but they kind of progressed in like related things to like younger demographic and like more like accessory play stuff to more like older of interest to older demographics like everyday functionality yeah', 'sentence-tokens': ['Ok so

this one 202 has more like identification stuff on it because like the barcode and I guess like where its made and the manufacturing information.', 'so maybe this is like I guess the brand I guess is more identifiable.', 'This one 201 I feel like of them all probably this 202 pink one seems the most durable probably do the most with it because you can like throw it up a bunch of things and its not going to like tear cause like this 204 could tear like it could get stained easier and these ones 201 203 are kind of soft.', 'This ones 203 like I guess is not fully formed.', 'It could be probably break the spikes off a little bit easier.', 'Is that enough detailsthis ones 207 like really interesting because its like it has like the little core but all the rest of like the ballish components are like individual.', 'I feel like this is like a good like one of those like sensory soothing like activities because you can kind of just like play with it more.', 'These ones 205 206 are like super similar, probably like same brand or something and they have like that gummy texture thing like plasticky kind of likei dont know.', 'I personally dont like the feel of these two 205 206 as much as like this one 207 or like that other one 204.', 'This one 208 is kind of cool because its like the map and stuff but the texture of it too is like feels kind of like almost like maybe it has foam or something and its kind of I dont know.', 'I feel like this one 208 will fall apart easier and its probably like less I dont know less you can like interact with it whereas this one 207 because its like not the full like solid circle.', 'I feel like this one would last the longest and like encourages interaction between a little and these 205 206 are just kind of like I feel like these are more like decoration so theres not as much to do with them and they seem like kind of weird to be like throwing or like they feel kind of weird at least to me to like touch for too long.', 'So I feel like these 205 206 would be like maybe like decoration and this 207 would be the one that you would probably like play with or like interact with the most because I feel like the most comfortable out of

it like adds some more like depth or something in it.', 'This brain one 210 I guess is also I guess a cool one because its like foamy and you could probably like squeeze it but it probably would get like a bunch of cracks if you squeeze it too much.', 'Maybe you cant do that.', 'Maybe this ones also more like a decoration one.', 'Then the Alien 209 is interesting because it has all these like holes in the back of it so I dont know if maybe it was supposed to like have like a spike and you could like hang it up or something orbut this ones like not really.', 'Its kind of solid so I guess its kind of like again I guess you could play like a toy.', 'maybe if you want a like alien toy but like again not something like some of the other ones 201208 where you could like use it as a stress ball or something like just to like do while youre like doing work or something you need something to feel and so yeah.', 'so the blue ones 211 definitely my favorite cause its kind of cool how you can like push your finger in and make the thing go other ways and then the dolphins are kind of cool as well and it has like sparkles in it as well which is also kind of nice.', 'These 213216 are cool because theyre like all I guess like the same like object just like different textiles and stuff.', 'but its cool that theyre all like the same.', 'These ones 213 214 probably came from like the same

kind of feel a difference but I feel like its not as big a difference as this pink one 213 and then this one 213 has more stuff in it cause I feel like its more substantiali guess I cant really stand upbut it 213 feels like its more like substantial than this one 214 Seems like its a little bit flimsyi guess theres just not as much stuff in it.', 'These ones 215 216 also I feel like are pretty

are also more colorful.', 'I feel like the 215 216 design is a little bit more aesthetically pleasing than the other ones 213 214 and probably this one 216 I think is my favorite because its like the bright yellow and it feels like I dont know, really bright and like summery and stuff.', 'So probably this ones 216 my favorite, This ones 214 probably my least favorite just because I dont know if I love the moths as much.', 'And its kind of like darker colors and not as bright and I guess its like summer I guess thats what Im gravitating towardsbut yeah yeah theyre all 213216 like pretty much the same thing just like different designs and like how the textile feels is like what kind of like differentiates this one 220 kind of gives like wedding dress vibes I guess cause its like the lace and it looks like very like elegant and its like embellished so and its like really thin and like seethrough as well.', 'This one 217 feels like the felt stuff so probably like maybe for making i dont know puppets I guess if youre making like patches or something but this ones definitely more like playing every day and like the color toored is like more like an everydayish color well I guess white 220whites also everyday color but this is like a more like fancy this ones 219 probably like in between.', 'This is probably the next fanciest one because its not like seethrough but its still like white with like the gold kind of like shimmery lines in it as well but its feels more like regular everyday clothes fabric but just has nicer designs.', 'Its probably the next fanciest one.', 'this 217 is the least fanciest one.', 'and then this one 218 I dont know what this is called but it 218 feels different than the other.', 'These two 217 219 like a little bit less soft and like cottony and its 218 like a burgundy.', 'So its again its like an everyday clothes like clothes like base of a clothe where I feel like this you wouldnt wear with a base of athis one 219 you could.', 'and then this 220 is just like a decoration on top of the clothes.', 'and then the burgundy 218i feel like this 217 is like a really really really bright red, but the burgundy is more like subtle.', 'So I feel like this 218 could maybe also be dressed up in maybe like a fancy like semicasual outfit whereas this 217 I feel like you would have to wearor you dont have to.', 'you have to wear this in a casual setting because of the feltish, but the color not so much.', 'But yeah, in terms of like fanciness of wearing to events, I feel like it would go this 220 to this 217 and these 217 220 are both cannot

clothing feel to it.', 'This one 221 looks like kind of like this costume like king or queen robes they would have and so but like the velvet the velvet is nice, like you could wear it in like the winter, maybe at like a nice like Christmas party or something like that.', 'I dont know but I dont know.', 'I personally dont really love the feel of velvet so I mean definitely more comfortable and pretty opposite to this one 224 This 224 is rough but I still dont really love this one 221 This ones 223 like ai guess this is like kind of is like a rug or I guess it could be like a shawl or like the lining of like those like really big winter coats that you buy this 223 ones also nice to just feel because its like really soft and likethe velvet 221i dont know this 223cause this 223 like has the stuff that like moves so I feel like its more fun to like go like the opposite directions in it so then I feel like its softer and like cooler.', 'This 222 is like that sherpaish stuff they make for like those like trucker jackets and like trucker hatsand so this ones 222 soft too.', 'This 222 is softer.', 'its 222 softer than this one 223 but I feel like you still 222 you dont have that fun like to go back and forth but this one 222 is definitely a lot softer and probably would be warmest.', 'I dont know maybe this 223 would be I dont know but these two 222 223 are probably like warmer.', 'Thats like the exact opposite of that 224 cause its all like holey and seethrough.', 'but this one 222 I guess also like would get dirty easier like it shows like stuff up on it more so like these ones 221 223 224 are like a little bit more like they dont show like stuff that gets attached to it as much.', 'But yeah I guess in terms of like soft order this is like least soft 224 to most soft 222.', 'And then in terms of what I feel like you could comfortably wear as clothes as a full outfit itd probably be this 221 to this 224 because I feel like you could have a whole outfit of

guess theyre notnot that it progressed exactly like this but it kind of felt like it progressed kind of like functionalitywise because we started out with balls that are kind of like more like things to play with or like decoration and stuff and then we ended with fabrics that are more like you could wear or like maybe on like your chairs or like household items so they seem more like functional and like you would use maybe longer because I guess like you would use like these 201212 more like as kids something like that but since these are like fabrics like these 217224 would be more of

others like this hacky sack 204 is more malleable than like for example the pink bouncy ball 202 this 203 has suction on it which is in contrast to the other three 201 202 204 this one 201 is spiky which is in contrast to the other three 202204 since theyre all relatively smooth if you can call this 203 smooth um theyre all 201204 relatively the same size except the pink one 202 is bigger umm theyre allwell theyre all 201203 mostly bright except for the hacky sack 204 which has like bright accents but i would say is like tonally darker than the other three 201203 this 202 has writing on it which is different than the other three dropping all balls sequentially ooh this one 201 lights up thats fun ok well two of the balls 201 202 are like bouncier than the other two 203 204 because one 204 is like i dont know how you would describe this but it just sits when it falls instead of like tactilely bouncing and then the other one 203 again it has suction qualities so of course it would stick to the counter other differences and similarities they 201204 all feel good like none of them are painful to hold which is good because they all seem like childrens toys to some extent so good construction in that front um yeah i think some are more like relieving to squish than others like this 202 isnt that relieving because it doesnt really again its not really that squishy so it doesnt like give at all whereas like this one 201 in particular is nice and this 204 is less satisfying and so is the suction one 203 yeah should i go oni feel like yeah i feel like thats a good amountok whoa these 205208 are fun ok this is interesting these arent i dont know what shape i would designate this 205 but theyre not all 205207 like spherical except for the globe 208 which is different compared to last time 201204 but i guess they all have like a center of mass and are holdable so like you could consider them to be balllike in nature theres one 207 with a lot ofi dont know these aretassles but its 207 fun i feel like comparing the two similarly translucent ones 205 206 i prefer the one 206 thats more spherical in shape opposed to the one 205 thats more like pointy because its more satisfying to hold the sphericalish like softer one 206 or like softer edges one um theyre all 205208 very colorful and bright which is nice the sphereor the globe has a dent in it i feel like tactilely this 207 is the most intriguing because it feels almost like a mini hand massage when you squeeze it which is nice yeah i would say the most satisfying toy to hold is probably this one 206 still yeah i dont really know what else you can say about these 205208 oh my god i used to love these 211 as a kid ok i forget what these are called waterwater tubes i dont remember but wow this is a relic thats crazy ok well i automatically went to this water tube one because its nostalgic for me but also because like i think its the most dynamic out of these four objects 209212 that have been presented just because there are more components to it like the dolphins inside and also the fact that its like physically dynamic like you can see the shift in the material when you like play with it the alien 209 is fun he has some holes in him which is unfortunate but um not the most intriguing i dont know if thats because the green is muted and so its not like as eyecatching as like for example any of the past round toys 205208 or like even this water wiggler 211water wiggler thats what its called water wiggler i like the brain 210 its i feel like this is a stress ball just give him the context of it and the way that it feels when you squeeze it it does feel very stressbally and it has writing on it i feel probably least intrigued by the heart 212 and the alien 209 personally simply because like maybe its the context of the fact that this is a study thats focused on like touching things or like looking at specific objects that ive been able to like manipulate with my hands so far and like the fact that these two 209 212 dont fall in the category makes me less inclined towards them um but the heart 212 is intriguing when you look at it visually like theres something inside and i cant tell what it is maybe its just a break in the marbling oroh theres a hole at the bottom so its probably just like an alcoveoh this is ais this just a big bead i dont know but theres like a cavern inside the heart which is cool i didnt notice that before but optically its still not as intriguing as like the water wiggler 211 or even the brain 210 but yeah i like its 212 smooth texture which is nice i feel like those are my thoughts ooh this 214 is cool very cool ok these 213216 coin purses seem to be filled with different materials on the inside am i supposed to examine the inside as wellnot like visuallyok cool i mean i feel like with this ones 215 216 like with these coin bags 213216 itswell there are two like theyre kind of like paired off in terms of like patterns like there are two butterfly ones 213 214 and then there are two 215 216 like more swirlied designs like floral almost texturally i like this one 213 the least because its rough and whatever is inside it feels like beans or something or like rockssorry when i say its rough i mean like the internal like whatever is filling it is rough not the external yeah which is interesting because i think i prefer the feeling of this like the butterfly coin purses 213 214 because the fabric is softer than the swirled ones 215 216 like it feels less satisfying to like like move your thumb across the swirled patterns because its like a rougher texture but the filling inside of the yellow 216 swirled pouch is probably the most satisfying because its the most fine it feels like sand or some sort of powdery filling im not too sure i think in terms of eye catchiness the swirls 215 216 are definitely more vibrant because they have like in their threads its like more metallic and shiny in nature compared to like the butterfly pouches but yeah yeah i probably still prefer the butterfly ones 213 214 though just because of the way that they feel yeahso its 217220 four pieces of fabric interesting ok well first and foremost theres like a lacy pattern 220 compared to three other 217219 like more smooth consistent pieces of fabric so the lace is more like pliable almost because of its mesh just like being able to give way better than like a more tightly woven kind of fabric there besides the lace theres one other pattern fabric 219 and twocompared to like two solid block colored fabrics 217 218 and it 219 has a gold sort of accent on it which is nice with like some sort of shadowing in the back with like darker yeah like darker shadows amongst like the lighteri dont know what you would these like the designs like they almost look like waves or like like you know in animated movies when they animate a bird in the sky just like that but just with like gold outlines or shadowed or white and then one 217 of the red solid pieces of fabric feels felty which is like a contrast to like the two other 218 219 pieces of fabric besides the lace that feel like smooth almost in nature even though visually its smooth like the visually the red felt is smooth it like texturally you can feel a lot more resistance when you rub it compared to like this wine colored 218i think this is like cotton but or maybe its like polyester i dont know compared to this fabric 218 its interesting though is the felt 217 doesnt retain wrinkles in the way that the other fabrics do like for example the patterned light one 219 and also the lace one 220 and even the wine one 218 as wellthey all seem to retain wrinkles in a way that the felt doesnt maybe thats because its 217 like thicker yeah like you can feel it the felt is much thicker than its counterparts 218220 so perhaps that contributes to the antiwrinkleness yeah i think i like the feeling of the smoother fabrics 218 219 compared to the felt 217 and the lace 220 again maybe its the idea of like least resistance but like in terms of the most intriguing fabric it would have to either be the lace 220 or the pattern one 219 simply because there are patterns on them whereas the other two fabrics 217 218 like the red ones feel i dont know like almost boring even though theyre like bright colors like especially the felt 217 its like its its a bright red like its a crimson maybe butor like a cardinal but its not as intriguing simply because there are patterns that exist or like there are fabrics 219 220 that exist with patterns as opposed to like the red felt 217 just being like a block of red so even though its brighter its less intriguing visually ok this 221224 is cool so many textures oh i like this 222 this is nice ok so these four fabrics 221224 have a lot more texture in comparison to the last one 217220 theres like a satiny kind of velvet 221 like a fuzzy sherpa 222 and something 223 that feelsi dont know how youd describe thisits just like fur and then like a netted kind of mesh 224 i think right off the bat i appreciate the velvet 221 and the sherpa 222 the most again maybe its because theyre the least resistant like in terms of like feeling like texturewise like they feel the smoothest and so i find them the best to like touch over like a longer period of time i also think like my eye is typically more drawn to brighter colors so like i see the red satin 221 and also like bright as in like light too and i see like the light the reflective nature of like the sherpa 222 and so like my eyes are automatically drawn to these 221 222 the the most compared to like the net 224 which is like pretty matte in color cause it doesnt really reflect that much um but im like less intrigued by the hairor by the fur 223 because it almost feels too humanistic so it 223 feels like bizarre to like you know run my hand through that excessively compared to like something 222 thats sherpay and reminds me a lot of like my stuffed animals at home and like something 221 thats like visually very satisfying im talking about the red velvet satin piece but yeah yeah i guess its not unsatisfying to like touch the the netted pattern 223 its just because like in some ways its similar to the feeling that i had when i was holding the pom pom 207 because its like theres some disturbance i suppose but like in a comforting way whereas like this 222 provides like no resistance like this 224 provides some resistance and it almost feels like like i know i described that 207 as like a hand massage and like this is pretty similar i would say in terms of the way that i perceive the texture because its like consistent in anits inconsistently consistent so it provides some resistance but like in a way thats expected and like not surprising or like jarring which is like how i interpreted this 205 kind of feeling compared to the other smooth similar ball 206 yeah i dont know if thats a way that i should that that makes sensei have a lot of appreciation for the water wiggler 211 i havent played with one of those in a long time yeah i feel like thats basically it yeah i perceived this hair 223 as like almost featherlike at the beginningand i dont know if thats because of like a mental association with like fur and feathers as being very similar to one another like in contrast to like the sherpa 222 which i also perceive as like wooly and furry yeah thats another observation', 'sentence-tokens': ['Cool.', 'Well, theyre 201204, All spherical in nature, some are squishier than others like this.',

white.', 'And then one 217 of the red solid pieces of fabric feels felty which is like a contrast to like the two other 218 219 pieces of fabric.', 'besides the lace that feel like smooth almost in

thicker yeah like you can feel it.', 'The felt is much thicker than its counterparts 218220 so perhaps that contributes to the antiwrinkleness.', 'Yeah I think I like the feeling of the smoother

bat, I appreciate the Velvet 221 and the Sherpa 222 the most.', 'Again, maybe its because theyre the least resistant, like in terms of like feeling like texturewise, like they feel the smoothest And

material its pretty light in weight what i like about it its very nice and spherical it can roll around it seems pretty even it seems like all the little protrusions are like the same height theyre very uniform theres a lot of symmetry in this object only dislike is that maybe like the tactile sensation its a little prickly but no problem this is also a spherical object 203 its different in that its protrusions are suction cup shaped and it seems that there are like differentiations in like the body of the object like theres a smaller clear ball thats also transparent and then there are the very opaque protrusions that come in green blue and red seems like its pretty yeah its suctiony thats fun like that only dislike it makes a weird noise when you like stick and then you remove it i dont know if i like that noise this 202 seems like the most uniform the mostdare i saybasic of all the objects its a pink bouncy ball it says high bounce pinky thats fun bounces pretty nice other things this is not transparent which is very different from the other objects 201 203 i like the feeling its very its kind of its very smooth like that its also like pretty i suppose compared to these its a lot heavier a lot denser yeah theres nothing that i particularly dislike about this object only that its not more exciting ok oh this alsooh 202 rolls awaythis 204 is kind of like i know the shape name im just forgetting it but this is not a circle lets see its woven i think i like this object the most out of all of them lets see it has black yellow green red it has a very intricate design to it it seems like there are a lot of diamonds triangles and things of that matter yeah its its a nice subject its seems like it has like a beanish material inside of it its pretty squishy feels nice its also i would say its not as dense as thiswell definitely not as dense as this 201 not more dense than this 202 its like kind of like in the middle theres something that i dont like about this object i think im good thank youok well i really like this 205 this is veryvery intricate its kind of like it took a ton of like stars and wove them together so i like that a lot there are a lot of different colors here theres green purple yellow orange pink a lot of nice colors theres a lot of like empty space in this object it seems that like the majority of like the density is like located towards like the outer portions of the object where the middle of the object is left pretty basically empty as for the material its very rubbery its not like the rubber itself is like difficult to see through its transparent yep it can bounce which is cool and its very very lightweight yeah i dont necessarily like the tactile sensation especially like at the rounded bits i dont know feels a little odd otherwise i like this object a lot this 206 is just basically like this object 205 but its smooth yeah its very like woven it seems like the rubber bits on this one are like a little more difficult to see through so less transparent i have yellow blue green purple orange a lot of different colors that are woven together again like it seems like the majority of like the density of this object is located portions leaving the inside basically air its pretty light also can bounce yeah i dont think theres anything i think i like the tactile sensation of this 206 a lot more than that 205 because its like a lot smoother this 207 looks really fun lets see its kind of like kinda reminds me of like a toilet cleaner yeah its yellow and green its very like its very light most of the density of the object is located in the very middle which makes it interesting to hold theres a lot of little spindles here which is interesting its almost like hairlike to touch which is kind of nice i wouldnt say theres anything that i dont like about the object other than i wish that the density was like distributed a little more evenly thats that and then its 208 like a mini globe but in like bouncy ball form yep a lot of nice colors here have green pink purple orange yellow blue white again it is a globe and it bounces it seems to touch its pretty smooth kind of plasticky a little sticky to touch theres nothing that i oh its also very foamy material its easy to squish which is nice kind of like a stress ball yeah i dont think theres anything that i dont really like about this object gotcha this one 211 is very interesting this is really interesting to touch it just rolled that was interesting ok but its kind of cool its blue theres this very plasticky outside and there are like 3 segments that are like containing like this blue liquid or the liquid could be clear and the plastic could be coloring it blue there are dolphins in here thats pretty nice dont know if i also mentioned the glitter very squishy but it seems pretty fragile were going to be very careful about that i think its very interesting to touch again very sticky um yeah its like of a decent weight i wouldnt say its particularly heavy but its not very light either one thing i dont like about this object is that when i hold it sometimes it like rolls and i dont like that but yeah i think thats all for that object its 212 a little heart its pretty cute its kind of glittery in there it seems like theres some glass work going on which is really neat its red its in a heart but its not 2d its not flat at all its kind of rounded its pretty light but also seems kind of fragile like if youif i try to bounce this it could break yeah nice nice object i dont think theres anything that i dislike about it this 210 is a nice little brain oh purple brain though and its foam yeah you can see all the gyrate sulci very cool again like kind of like a stress ball its pretty smooth to touch its pretty light i wouldnt say theres anything out of the ordinary or like anything particularly that jumps out to me about this object other than its shape and its very light because of the foam its 209 like an alien ok this is fun its very bright green i dont know if i mentioned that 210 was purple this 209 is very bright green has alien eyes has a little smile which is cool has a humanoidish body i dont know if i necessarily like the material its not squishy and it has holes on the backside of it which is interesting it doesnt seem like it can stand up by itself so it seems like seems like the majority of the materials concentrated in the head which i dont know maybe that is what aliens would be like but i dont know its an interesting object i just dont like how it feels necessary um its a little i dont know its very very smooth and again i dont like that all the density is here yeah oh ok these 213216 are very nice i like these a lot this 216 seems like it has sand in it but it seemswell this looks like a coin purse its kind of like the top portion is crescent shaped in the bottom portion is rectangular yeah theres sand in here meaning that i can squish it pretty easily and that if i like plop it itll take the the material at the bottom will kind of spread out a bit i like the golden detailing theres also yellow and white detailing theres a lot of like wave shaped and like paisley decorations and whatnot it seems like someone took a lot of time to make this and then the top portion is like very like almost mirrorlike metallic and it has like two um bulbs that like come together in a clasp and i can see that theres a rubber band to keep it from opening all of these objects 213216 have like the same exact shape and the only thing that seems to differ from object to object is maybe the sensation of the fabric and like the fabric pattern this 216 is a lot just because of its goldish material its a lot more prickly when you like wipe your finger across it but this 213 is a lot smoother lets see its 213 red there seem to be like pink butterflies which is pretty cool that looks kind of caterpillarish interestingly but that could just be my eyes yeah pink butterflies with like gold little antenna and like a gold body which is pretty cool but the red background and then this one 215 actually yeah this 215 is similar to this 216 and this 213 is similar to that this 214 this 215 also has like silver detailing it has a lot of paisley and swirls and waves as well theres like as for like the thread that they use like the background is blue and the threading is seems to be like yellow gold pink i think yeah i think those are the only colors and its also like prickly if you wipe your finger across it and then this guy 214 has black background very similar butterflies and whatnot except that it seems like the body of the butterfly is white with gold and pink detailing and it seems like the body and antenna are white as wellthis seems like something all 217220 these fabrics seem like things that you would put on top of a table as it is ok maybe for like decoration or whatnot theyre all in like squares this 217 is more rectangular the rest of these 218220 seem to like pretty uniform squares its 220 very flat the material of this its very lacy it seems to be like theres its also white it seems to be like a floral design with like vines and then at the top it has like i dont know what to call this but it looks like just like a bunch of ms and then this 218 is like very like smooth almost like reminds me of like pillow cases yeah its very smooth its red its very uniform in color whereas this one 220 like it seems like a lot of the fabric is concentrated towards like the flowers and whatnot and like in the open space where there are vines its more lacy and theres and you can see through to the table more but this 218 is pretty uniform theres nothing thati dont know i dont necessarily like the texture of this one 220 i like prefer the texture of this one 218 because its smoother it seems like there are all these little wispy bits at the edges and yeah its pretty pretty uniform in color theres no variation really this one 217 is felt felt rectangle bright red again like very uniform its veryi dont know how to describe this it just feels like what felt feels like but thats its not very uniform it seems like there are like i dont know if i were to look at it this way i think theyre like hills and valleys like it within the felt itself that account for like its unique texture so its not exactly uniform its not like this 218 like itsi dont know its a little bumpier i suppose so thats that one 217 and then this 219 oh i like this one the most its very soft lets see it has like gold detailing it looks like a kind of like grass lets see the background is white and then it seems like around the gold detailing theres like grayish contours which account for like the grassy look umm yeah its pretty nice pretty uniform but this 219 is thicker than this 218 and thats why i prefer this one this 217 is i would say the thickest material this 220 is the thinnest and then yeah second thickest 219 second thinnest 218  wow ok my grandma had a rug that was like similar material to this 223 oh lets see its 223 very kind of like very bumpy on the back not very smooth at all like would catch your finger if you ran it across not very pleasant to touch this is like very like smooth and soft its like hairlike all the hairs are pretty long but theyre not uniform in length which is interesting its black yeah and i i like the way that this feels because its pretty soft theres nothing that i really dislike about this cloth other than the back of it this 222 is really nice too i think i have like a jacket thats this material its white and it has these little black bits but im pretty sure thats not from the cloth itself but its probably from being with this guy 223 its it seems like thewell the hair is like a lot coarser or its like rounded to give off like a coarser appearance i dont know if i already mentioned that its white and it seems that the backside of this is a lot smoother compared to the backside of this one 223 and it seems like the hair 222 is like almost like sheared like if i were to cut all the fabric like with i dont know shears or something like that it would give like the same appearance appearance as this this 224 is i dont like the way it feels its very like seethrough very knitted but the quality of the knit itself is not very soft the material that was used to knit this is like pretty harsh its not very i know it wouldnt be nice to wear it would probably be pretty itchy its black its very seethrough like if you try to stretch or pull at these fabrics this 222 gives a little bit this 223 doesnt really give at all but this one 224 gives quite a bit itll like alter like the rectangle also square 223 square 222 rectangleish 224 depending on how you pull it but usually a square and this 221 is also looks to be a square yeah i dont really like the feel of this 224 and i dont know if theres anything that i really like this one it just seems like would be very uncomfortable to wear this one 221 this is interesting i dont know if i necessarily like the fabric because its very thin also this 223 i would say is the thickest or appears the thickest ok this appears the thickest because of the hair but the hair itself is not very thick its actually pretty thin but this 222 actually like is the thickest because like its a lot denser and then this 223 i would say is the thinnest and this 221 would id say is like the second thinnest it 221 seems like let me see ok now its red but its not very uniform in color it seems like theyre depending on how the light shines on it there are like a lot of contours to like the way that the material is um its like red scarletish its like nice if you like keep your hand like on it like very uniformly and dont move it around but if you like try to move your hand across it it feels kind of bumpy but like smoothish and i know thats confusing but i mean like its not i would say ok like in terms of like smoothness i would say this 224 is not smooth at all its like relatively itchy i would say like this 221 isnt itchy its like smooth and then like the back of it its also pretty smooth it seems a bit knit lets see it is the majority of the background is black but it seems to have these little red fibers interspersed that give it like a kind of like a maroon appearance its pretty smooth umm i would say this material the feeling of it is like middle between like this 224 and like this 221 front material so its like kind of like relatively smooth but you can still like feel how woven it is which you dont get that with this 222 or that 223 i would say that these these two 217220 and 221224 well these this one 221224 two 217220 and three 213216 id say these are like the most uniform like groups that you have brought out and id say that these 201212 are like the most spontaneous and vary the most between them', 'sentence-tokens': ['Well, this 201 is a blue ball.', 'It has spikes all around

like alter like the rectangle.', 'Also Square 223 Square 222 rectangleish 224 depending on how you pull it but usually a square.', 'and this 221 is also looks to be a square.', 'Yeah, I dont really like the feel of this 224 and I dont know if theres anything that I really like this one.', 'It just seems like would be very uncomfortable to wear this one.', '221 This is interesting.', 'I dont know if I necessarily like the fabric because its very thin.', 'Also, this 223 I would say is the thickest or appears the thickest.', 'Ok, this appears the thickest because of the hair, but the hair itself is not very thick.', 'its actually pretty thin.', 'But this 222 actually like is the thickest because like its a lot denser.', 'and then this 223 I would say is the thinnest and this 221 would Id say is like the second thinnest.', 'It 221 seems like let me see Ok now its red but its not very uniform in color.', 'It seems like theyre depending on how the light shines on it.', 'There are like a lot of contours to like the way that the material is.', 'um its like red scarletish.', 'Its like nice if you like keep your hand like on it like very uniformly and dont move it around.', 'but if you like try to move your hand across it.', 'It feels kind of bumpy but like smoothish and I know thats confusing but I mean like its not.', 'I would say ok like in terms of like smoothness I would say this 224 is not smooth at all.', 'Its like relatively itchy.', 'I would say like this 221 isnt itchy, its like smooth and then like the back of it its also pretty smooth.', 'It seems a bit knit, lets see it is.', 'The majority of the background is black but it seems to have these little red fibers interspersed that give it like a kind of like a maroon appearance.', 'Its pretty smooth.', 'umm I would say this material the feeling of it is like middle between.', 'like this 224 and like this 221 front material.', 'So its like kind of like relatively smooth but you can still like feel how woven it is

uniform like groups that you have brought out and Id say that these 201212 are like the most spontaneous and vary the most between them.']}, '112': {'statements': 'ok sounds good ill just put this on the floor its falling fantastic all 201204 of these are balls um one of them this one 201 is spiky its seethrough it seems that if you hit it its gonna light upred and blue lights theres a seam going down the middle and a battery which lights it or like helps it light up theres a little bit of fuzz on it um its squishy as well and lets see ok its number three now lets look at second one 204 this one is squishing a different way because it has some kind of beans inside maybe rice its got a knit fabric the fabric is kind of malleable also in the shape of a ball but its kind of like a cylinder actually because the green suns on the top and bottom are more flat than the rolly part the the the design is yellow green red and black and triangles with lines and suns that are green on the flatter sides its fun to squish alright lets look at number one 203 um this is the smallest one its supposed its supposed to have suction cups nice good sound i like the sound its green on top blue in the middle and red on the bottom or whatever red on top either way and the little suction cups are connected by a what looks like some kind of plastic little thin tube to a cylindrical and clear plastic center that center is hollow um its also squishy all right moving on to number 4 202 the biggest one its the least squishy so thats disappointing it says high bounce pinky with two stars on the sides and then on the back its got like information about where its made and stuff it has an indentation which says jaru in the center it has a line cutting through it because likely the way it was made is that it had two parts and then they were squished together which is why it doesnt look completely circular or spherical just nothing really can be really its pink and its my least favorite thats about it well all of the other ones 201 203 204 are fun see this one 203 has suction cups this one 204 is like beans and its notits like cylindrical this one 201 lights up and its spiky and its like seethrough and itsand this one 202 its not even hollow like theres nothing interesting inside of it its probably the same consistency throughout its like just not interesting as much and its not squishy enough it doesnt have enough information going on like the texture is just boring except for this middle line this 201 texture is nice in my hand this 204 texture is squishy is nice this 203 is like like my second least favorite texture but like at least its interesting you know im saying but anyway thats itbro these 205208 are also like balls ok i mean theyre not actually balls but the other ones 201204 werent really either this one 208 is the most balllike and it reminds me the most of the boring pink one 202 but this ones 208 not boring because when you its more squishy and when you squish it it makes a nice sound and it lets out air ok sorry its been a long day its got a globe on it and im not going to describe the globe because it seems to be just a regular earth situation going on its like spongy inside i like this one a lot but its painted over with like that stuff thats like a little bit sticky its ok i like dont mind it actually does have a little bit of an indent here right under australia probably so it doesnt roll away alright lets take a look at the next one 207 dont like it lets just describe it without this one is green and yellow it has a horrible texture its so the green and yellow spaghettis are kind of theyre made out of a stretchy material if you stretch it a little bit it turns white and in the middle likely its tied together by some sort of small metal circle and thats why theyre all staying together and thats why its not exactly a sphere becausegrossbecause its tied together in the middle like when you have like a stack of things and then you like hold in the middle and then if they all fall apart because theyre floppy it kind of looks like a circle its not it has like a hair stuck in it its a horrible texture thejust starting from the middle and going out the little spines things seem to be about an inch long i feel like if it werent such a long day i might like the texture but i dont like the texture these two 205 206 are kind of the same except for one of them is soft 206 and one of them is hard 205 um the hard one 205 seems to be stars thats a five pointed stars with a little spherish thing at the end of each point and there are there are one two three four five six of the stars theyre interwoven actually made an origami piece exactly like this oh but not made out of rubber or whatever this is the material thats made out of is rubbery malleable seethrough well kind of it lets the light in but my hand is distorted when i look through it you can see through it each of the holes you can see through is in the shape of a pentagon because its stars and they each have five sides between each of thebetween thre pentagons is like a little bit of a triangle with the points of the stars sticking up the colors are pink yellow orange green blue and purple purple one is my favorite its i wonder if it bounces it does but not satisfactorily satisfyingly whatever its ok this one 206 is the soft one but its basically the same so instead of points on the stars its like a flower shape but there is still five sides actually the same colors as well so there are five of five of these flower shapes as well interwoven in the exact same way to make pentagons in the middle i definitely made an origami shape thats this idea uhohnope i got it out its the perfect size between the pentagons to like fit a finger in but then you might get stuck but you cant get it stuck because it moves this one 206 i like much more because you can touch the middle like in the middle you can just like squeeze it flat this is lovely definitely my favorite one ok we should move on ok the heart 212 is amazing fantastic its a bead which means that its first of all its made out of glass with a little bit of a i really like it a shiny thing in the middle and thats like sparkly and then its like clearish glass but like with a red tint on the outside its in the shape of a heart but also threedimensional going through it vertically which is to say between the two front top lobes and then out of the bottom point theres a hole so that you can string it because its a bead this might actually be plastic its kind of cold though i dont know im gonna go with glass this is my favorite one first of all cause its very shiny ill put that first this alien 209 is like what one would consider to be like a martian maybe oh my gosh no what is this made out of ok this thing its green its about half the size of my palm actually its its basically just the size of my full palm if you dont include the fingers and also the wingspan is from the side to side of my palm so its like a solid side its green and it has a eggshaped head but the egglike upside down egg the head is the thickest part except for the buttocks nope the buttocks is the second thickest part um there is no theres no buttcrack though theres like a a seam all along the body of the alien from toes to the top of the head including the arms thats maybe how they put it together theres a little bit of a scratch through the eyes which are black theres a small smile no nose everything else is green on the back there are holes two slightly above the wrist two but not straight slightly on the like below the neck on the spine two each below the butt and then three on the right side and two and a halfish on the left side right above the ankle the feet are pointing outwards but i can actually mold this material to have them face face forward which we should do it seems that on the feet there are three toes the front toe pointing out the most and then the middle toe in the middle and the bottom pinkyish very short on the hands weve got a very short thumb and then three fingers once again the pointer finger is the longest with the second finger being in the middle and the pinky being the shortest this material is really interesting the issue is that you cant mold the head the same way as you can move the body lets make him sit down oh my god he can do it crazy its fine ok now the relationship between these two 209 212 is interesting because one 212 is red and one 209 is green and he can hold the heart 212 its like you know complimentary or whatever nice dope brain 210 im saving the best for lastalthough purple is actually i mean i didnt save the best for last i took thethis one 212 yeah purple is my favorite color this 210 is a brain made out of the same squishy material as the globe circle 208 from the second set of circles this one says druthers title company llc and then some other stuff thats not as interesting this one also has a seam at the bottom of it um it doesnt have a brain stem its just got like the the the general brain its not a circle it lies flatish its threedimensional its purple ok ok from the seam it also gives off a little bit of a air because its squishy and spongy we like speaking of which theres writing on the back of this alien 209 as well cant read it though i dont have my reading glasses on ok green there are staticky black hairs on everything 211 oh theres a dolphins in here dude theres dolphins i like dolphins ok dolphins there are three dolphins theyre blue with a white bottom um there seems to be a hole at the base basically where a dolphin hole would be not at the top just like other holes like for other things this 211 it just defies description like theres nothing like its theres blue liquid inside thats like sparkly cause theyre sparkles in the liquid and ill just hold it over the table its never ending but there is an end because theres like a seam just like theres a seam for everything else its just that this seam moves well its not the seam that moves its just that theres water in it and sorry ok its its really cool so how do i describe the shape of this its not holding ill just use two hands and i dont this is really cool actually i think ive seen one of these before but it was like a long time ago ok lets take a look at the shape it just says made in ningbo china and then some other numbers this shape isok so kind of cylindrical from the outside and then its like a doughnut but thicker like a doughnut is kind of like a circle but this is a cylinder instead and it the the the doughnut just keeps going in on itself its like eating itself and its like you know like the world and shityou know like these dolphins like theyre gonna die and then like crabs will eat them and then something will eat the crabs and theyll go back up and then like dolphins will be there again its like a circle of life but its slippery oh so cool dude i want one of these things yes yes thats alright ill play with it afterwardsoh no oh my gosh oh my gosh i love these 213216 theyre so pretty ok i have to i have to order them this one 214 has the least amount of some kind of silicone bead in it orits rice isnt it its just rice this has the least amount of rice in it so im going to put it first thats not why its actually just because i really like the butterflies ok um this 215 is the second this isnt even rice in here this is just beads theyre like cylindrical beads not cylindrical spherical beads i dont like it ill rank itits second in fillingno its first in filling isnt it itsok 215 214 im gonna make two rows actually im gonna make a row of ones that i like and a row of ones that i dont like but theyre gonna have the same amount of filling this one 215 is the row that i dont like and this one 214 is the row that i do like but this one 214 has rice in it this one 215 has beads in it this one 216 i like its going in this row lets figure out what it has in it though its filled more so i cant actually figure outoh it has rice i like it it has rice this one 213oh dude thats crazythis one also has the same spherical beads heres the thing though is really interesting is that i actually liked these two 214 216 more than these two 213 215 before i knew that they had rice in them kind of just like built different like i knowi know like i just like rice more so i knewi knew thats what was gonna be in them anyway so lets start with the favorite one it 214 has butterflies on it the butterflies seem to be made made of some silk and handwhatevered into the other shitsorry no more swearing theres pink white and gold on a black background it feels really nice to pet but only in one direction in the other direction no but the direction of petting on the butterflies is the opposite its like perpendicular to the direction of petting on the black background fabric ok ok so all 213216 of these are purses theyre coin purses they have a metal clasp and then at the very top in order to open it if theyre werent a rubber band around it umm there are two little balls that rub against each other and make it hard to open unless you use a little bit of force lets move on to the next coolest one 216 this one also has rice in it its yellow it has a paisley pattern with white yellow and gold once again its made out of the same material with the same kind of metal clasp enough said this one 215 is my least favorite probably because of the color scheme this one has a small amount of spherical beads i cant figure out what else that could be oh wait im sorry theyre not spherical theyre beans theyre not beads at all theyre beans and theyre not spherical this is rice this is beans with an n because they dont feel spherical they feel organic inside um yeah this one 215 is paisley too and it has pink blue silver and yellow which is too many colors and they clash but somebody put work into it so its still nice this one 213 is actually really cool it might be my second favorite after all maybe i just like the butterflies this one also has butterflies with pink gold and red red is the background and once again the butterfly petting should be done perpendicularly to the background petting absolutely this ones 214 nice so pretty 217220 felt 217 red felt i forgot what thats 220 called other stuff 218 219 ok lets start with the beginninga very good place to start ok this 217 piece of felt is red it has a couple of black fluffies stuck to it as usual its cut with scissors but by a human hand because the edges are uneven its kind of rectangular well its mostly rectangular it lets a little bit of light in especially if i put it up to the ceiling light but you cant actually see anything except for light through it the texture is soft but in an uncomfortable way that we we dont like lets fold it next this ones 220 really pretty this is what a wedding veils are made out of its sparkly its got a net in the background and then lace on top but this lace is like made out of a synthetic material probably not by a human hand completely its stretchy the pattern is flowers with two waving lines at the top didnt realize it was the top maybe its the bottom whatever um on the other side on the backside theres no sparkly bit and actually kind of like it more like this it seems to be like kind of like a square but once again cut by human hands with scissors so not exact ill just fold it up on top there next uhoh this 218 is fraying its some kind of magenta color it has a white puff on it its fraying more on these three edges that arent whatever thats called in sewing when you like double sew it stitched it whatever but its fraying everywhere its just fraying more evenly and with smaller things on the this side somebody has folded it there are two folds right here two creases and then theres like an inverted crease like a like a valley crease as opposed to a mountain crease in the middle exactly in the middlenot exactly in the middle this is also somewhat of a square but its been cut by human hands and it looks like it comes from a like a fancy napkin but actually its not as absorbent as a fancy napkin and you can still see through it this one 219 is the second most seethrough after the veil 220 and its a pillowcase maybe somebody has pulled out the stitches from the side it could have been a pillowcase but i dont think it was considering this like this little green stitch right here its in the pattern of cotton or clouds its or barley its white and brown with gold outline this one is also in the shape of a square and it is fraying except for on the side where its not no it looks like barley from mushroom barley soup seewhat is this 221 called again velvet this is like is that what velvet is i forgotalright ok so this 221 is stretchy its got some sort of like stretchy back to it but its more stretchy one way than the other its more stretchy vertically than horizontally i can tell that this is the top because this is where the the stitching was this was definitely part of a shirt because it has this stretchy part on the top or skirt maybe it was part of a piece of clothing though its red and its soft and you like i like petting it one way but not the other way its slightly rectangular cut by human hands this 224 is likeso its on the tip of my tongue like t th th whats that stuff that you make with hemp well its like kind of like a bag mesh like like it starts with a th i dont remember this is shedding a little bit but only one thing at a time at the very top its a little tighter this is like one of those patterns that you can make by going like under over under over and then doing it horizontally and vertically but i dont think this was made without the help of some sort of machine because its too thin this is gray its not actually stretchy its like fake stretchy just cause therere like holes um its nice if you like look at it kind of looks like an outdoor table mat type thing or maybe you could sit on it outdoors like some sort of outdoor furnitureyou know this batch 221224 and that batch 217220 are the same and like the first two batches 201208 are the same but the purse batches 213216 like out of nowhere ruby out of nowhere oh its 222 soft its so soft this side is ok its also soft um it doesnt look soft though like it does look soft but this side looks softer this side looks like a sheep but when like if you really like scrub a sheep so its not dirty and this side just looks like its like you know been made which i dont like as much this is a like a ivory or like a cream color its very fluffy it looks like cottage cheese or like if if like milk spoils too long dont eat ityou can like imprint your hand in there its like memory foam nope its like the opposite like you can put your hand and feels nice like its sinking into something you take your hand out boom its its not like changed anything in the fabric this could be like a bad idea for a builtin rug in an apartment where people like like it for the first month and then all of a sudden theyre like this is hard to wash and nobodys gonna buy it from usthis is you could have tricked me and maybe think this was a square if it were like this way oh wait no actually i disagree now its definitely a rectangle its a rectangle its like a subtle rectanglethis 223 is like i dont like this its supposed its like fur but its definitely fake right like this one 222 is a nice fluffy thing this ones 222 just like feels like its all gross and matted like if i if i pet it one way its like alright you know if i pet it the other way bad also on the bottom only half of it is cut and then the other half is just like somebody just like cut half their hair its soft but like not in a good way kind of looks likejust looks like hair that somebody didnt take care of too well like this is sad i dont like it it has to be on a pet one way its black and it is a rectangle well like i said the color scheme is the same for these two 217224 because its just reds whites and like black here actually only added black 223 224 to this one 221224 this 217220 is mostly red this 221224 was only one red 221 these 217220 are two whites 219 220 this 221224 is one white 222 but anyway there are these 217220 are smaller in general but theyre both 217224 like fabrics like you could theoretically make clothes out of either of these 217224 i wouldnt recommend it though these 221224 are like heavier or like more bougie fabrics but like not like a comfortable way and these 217220 are fabrics that are more traditional except for the felt 217 which actually belongs in this category 221224 no i take it back its like it belongs in me in medium category in like a middle category um these 201212 are cool like these things i thought this was all just gonna be balls or like fidget toys the alien 209 doesnt fit and neither does the heart 212 like this whole thing 209212 is a mess like like these two

different sizes slightly different like probably volume obviously different colors color schemes and different textures different materials that theyre made out ofthis 201 looks like maybe like like a toy for pets or something its soft its made out of maybe like silicone kind of stretchy rubbery this 203 is also probably made out of some kind of like silicon type material with a plastic sphere in the center to which these sort of like these i dont know what you callthe suction cup sort of ends are connected this 202 is a rubber ball pink rubber bouncy ball this 204 is like a little bean ball with like some kind of thread pattern that surrounds the some kind of like bag that contains smaller particles probably used for recreation as well um this 203 is pleasant to touch its like soft and flexible here theres like different textural elements here so theres like a lot to sense this one 202 is just kind of uniformly consistent it looks like an eraser and its very light kind of fluffy but has some structural integrity to it as well this 201 is also like kind of fun to touch because it has a different textural patterns too has a little not spiky spikes theyre soft the color changes depending on how you look at it this one 204 feels like the safer thing to use because its just softer on the outside it has fabric around it and just kind of light doesnt seem like it could do too much harm none 201204 of these do but any case im like drawn to these 201 203 cause they have different textural elementsand theyre just kind of nice to touch yeah i think these 201204 could all be used as like fun toys for pets and children and other peoplei wonderyeah i guess im just like concerned about how these would be like disposed because i dont think these are recyclable but thats like all i have to saythese 205208 are very bright these 205 206 look like cousins of each other they look like some kind of like molecule going on this 205 is more angular this 206 is curvier the threedimensional structure of these two objects make them nice to touch too because theres like different different elements going on theres like the angles here 205 these are they have like little rounded points to them so thats nice i feel safe to touch this 208 is like like a foam globe very bright colors for all the different countries and feels like something that you could like maybe puncture a little too easily but seems like a nice light thing to touch this 207 is very colorful as well with the neon green and the highlighter yellow its 207 very these different little filaments that surround the center its 207 like a little pom pom right so its just sort of like vibrant and festivelooking and these 205 206 are also festive but sort of in a more subdued way maybe because of the shades or the tones of the colors are kind of neon but like a pastel neon um which is interesting to sort of like look at they and these 205 are like different stars these are like 5 pointed stars that are just like kind of put together um making this really interesting threedimensional shape i dont know what you call that shape and these 206 are clover no these are like five yeah these are like a flower structure like a flower shape that are put together cute colors kid friendly these 207 are also cute colors kid friendly yeah this 208 is the globe very airy foamy and this 207 is just very its like almost furry um theyre 205208 cute ok yeah so this 209 is a little alien guy like plastic pretty heavy theres some heft to it um kind of silly looking but colors vibrant so it has some allure there this 212 is like this is also quite hefty theres some weight to it cant tell what its made out of its like glass or like some kind of plastic its 212 a heart shape its it 212 looks almost like a candy the like it 212 has holes through it so you could probably incorporate it into some kind of like bead based jewelry yeah so there is some interesting volume going on there this 210 is a foam brain its light its i guess its supposed to be a stress ball um its 210 purple so thats like a silly color for a brain so its like cute and this 211 is i forget what theyre called but i used to play with these 211 a lot as the kid i dont know the purpose of these 211 would be except its just like slippery kind of because of the way its you know what you call it its 211 like a little pocket but the pocket itself is like filled with fluid it has like a little glitter and little dolphins in it there that are like swimming in a little tank the color is very nice id be very drawn to this color when i was young this like cerulean blue was really like refreshing to me and made me think about like water from like video games that i would see and would be good on a hot summer day its very fun to play with its like you dont know which direction its gonna go so that element of surprise is amusing yeah these are also quite cute and fun to play with yeah ok yeah so little coin purses 213216 tied at the top with rubber bands theyre made they have different patterns to them but they all seem to like be from the same manufacturer maybe because the tops they have this like polished steel look to them with the little balls at the top to like clip it in place yeah so this 217 is a bright red very blaring red felt fabric piece it has that yeah its like felted wool good for winter when youre cold ok so this 221 is like velvet stretchy velvet spandexy fabric could reminds me of like maybe like robes that somebody might wear at home like a velvet robe or like the like the baby fat juicy couture era where people were wearing those like velvet track suits you know that kind of like what is this called its like its velvet but it has that like waviness to it and like it shifts tone depending on like how the light reflects off of it so thats interesting it creates like like the illusion of texture like more kinds of texture its very soft but i dont really like this type of fabric because it catches like lint so easily and its like very it stands out when you get lint on it its sort of hard to make it look very elegant in my opinion although like thats sort of what its going for its nice to the touch i would like it for like maybe a pet to like lie down in um no theyre all just like random things that somebody collected over time and have like different textural and like color or and structural elements i did like these i liked this one 203 in terms of touching theres like a delicacy to it it feels good against fingers here because its soft and like kind of

well this one 201 is blue and spiky and its kind of jellylike so even though theres spikes theres not its like not like hard to like touch it oh my god and it lights up it lights up it has flashing blue and red lights on the inside and it doesnt like hurt its not like pins and needles you know like a porcupine  oh my god yeah and its 204 like made out of like thread and like yeah do you need moretheyre all 201204 balls all spheres spherical i think ok and thats it i think ok this ones 207 like kind of hairy but its not hair its just like it floats around like that its green and yellow it does not bounce i dont think it bounces but its a nice ball even though maybe it is a ball but its not really its a pseudoball this one 206 has like all colors of the rainbow like the roy g biv thing and its like interwoven throughout each other and its like kind of jelly so its like squishy but its a its a good ball and i think thats mostly what i have i think mmmmam i answering good oh great and this is i dont know what material this might be it could be like resin or glass i dont think its stone it could be i it is glass because theres like marbling throughout it i think and theres like if you look closely at it theres like sparkles on the inside and like its also like a red heart so thats cute and then i think its like probably like a bead because theres like a piece drilled out of the middle so you could like fit something through there like thread but yeah its cute yeah ok gosh ok i think theres like can i open them no ok theres rubber bands on that to prevent me from ok these 213216 are like little coin purses i think or like penny pouches and they have like ornate like embroidery on them like this one 216 in particular has like its yellow lime green yellowish color but theres like gold embroidery white embroidery and its really pretty i think it the im not it might be paisley like the style thats on there but im not quite sure um but its pretty like i can like i dont know maybe like sand or rice this 215 one it might be am i allowed to like deeply touch them like it 215 might be like beads on the inside just because like the grain size is like larger than like this 216 one and i can like feel like a more distinct shape to them um but nothing feels like jagged so i think like whatever is in here is like probably round and like rounded um this one 219 is a piece of fabric its like mostly white its very pale in color but theres like a little bit of like gold detailing strewn throughout it and theres like a tiny bit of like maybe like a beige color im not sure but like lighter than the white of the background but like still pretty light in color it might be like oh no its like the same material as like what you would use for bed sheets and its 219 a square and thats about all i have for those 217220oh my gosh yeahok so this 221 is like i think this is crushed velvet it feels very soft to the touch and theres like its like mostly red it actually is all red but like just because of like the way like crushed velvet is theres like different shades so its like some parts are like lighter and some parts are darker but thats it looks nice on the back it is not crushed velvet its like something its nice oh its its also stretchy it has like a little bit of give to it so it might be like spandex or not im not sure ok and then it 223 feels very soft though its like black in color the backside is like very the backside is more rough theres like a little bit of glue on the sides um its not furry but it kind of looks like knit on the background on the back of it yeah just like from like the stitching i guess umm but yeah like maybe not sure and this 224 might be like burlap or tweed im not sure and its in the color black its another square this side is like whats it called i dont know like hemmed i guess like the sides are like folded down and like secured but on the rest of the sides its like open i dont think so well ok which group this 221 was part of this 221224 ok um each group presented seems to have like something connecting them so like the first group 201204 was like balls or like spheres like i think the first group might have been like you know like stuff thatll like help you like with like fidgeting and stuff like that second group was it was these 209212oh ok yeah yeah um those 205208 also might help with like fidgeting but like theyre like mostly like spherically shaped those are like kind of like toys but then that 213216 group is like all like pouches with something on the inside like fabrics more fabrics but like textures but i dont know theyre theyre not like randomly assorted like they all seem to have like a similarity between them ', 'sentence-tokens': ['Ok ok ok no I just start with

be I it is glass because theres like marbling throughout it I think and theres like if you look closely at it theres like sparkles on the inside and like its also like a red heart so thats cute and then I think its like probably like a bead because theres like a piece drilled out of the middle so you could like fit something through there like thread but yeah its cute.', 'Yeah ok gosh ok I think theres like can I open them no ok theres rubber bands on that to prevent me from ok. these 213216 are like little coin purses I think or like penny pouches and they have like ornate like embroidery on them like this one 216 in particular has like its yellow lime green yellowish color but theres like gold embroidery white embroidery and its really pretty.', 'I think it the im not it might be paisley like the style thats on there but Im not quite sure um but its pretty like I can like I dont know maybe like sand or rice this 215 one it might be am I allowed to like deeply touch them like it 215 might be like beads on the inside just because like the grain size is like larger than like this 216 one and I can like feel like a more distinct shape to them.', 'um but nothing feels like jagged so I think like whatever is in here is like probably round and like rounded.', 'Um this one 219 is a piece of fabric.', 'its like mostly white.', 'its very pale in color but theres like a little bit of

{'statements': 'ok ok not right now can i ask you questions while i great yeah so this 204 is a hacky sack which reminds me of when i was in college and the students used to play with us all the time out in the fields at cal poly where i went to school and its i like the feel of it it looks like its handmade crocheted nicely the colors remind me of reggae kind of reminds me of bob marley like a virus it reminds me of of that too but i really like how this one feels on my hands it smells plastic didnt really smell the other ones for some reason i wanted to do that those 202 201 have very different smells this 201 one smells very plastic the color is uniform in this 201 one unlike the other ones 202 203 204 this one 202 has the writing on it which distinguishes it from the others and this 204 one is the design is beautiful and it also reminds me of when i used to crochet things so its bringing back some memories of that this 203 one this is one of those ones you throw against the wall and it sticks are you do you have to like get it wet this one 203 i like the way this feels too but its like the opposite of this guy 201 as far as how it feels on my fingers and this one 203 consists of three different colors the red and the blue and the green and the red has seven protruding pieces and the green does too and then theres one two three four five six seven eight blue ones around the center and yeah i think yeah so this 203 one kind of sticks oh thats interesting guess it does that that ones fun to play with so how long am i supposed to continue to describe these things just as long as i ok and this 202 one this one feels like good like a stress ball like i like to squeeze it and it feels good that feels good i like the hardness of it its got just enough give to like feel like you can work it squeezing it then when i squeeze this 201 one that one feels like i almost can pop it if i squeezed it really hard that 203 feels nice to squeeze too yeah this 204 one kind of makes me want to go outside and this 202 one makes me want to play with my dog um so if i was to pick the one that i liked the best because i know that you said that i would say the one that i like to hold the best is this 201 one because its just kind of more interesting the way it feels umm but the one like i like visually the best is this 204 one these colors are again like i said they kind of remind me of of my college days and listening to bob marley and reggae and just kind of a freedom of the outdoors like in the summer when you could go outside and just be casual and relaxed so it has a good feeling that way to me so i dont know which one i like i like them all 201204 actually in different ways i think so yeah so these 205208 these seem very different in a lot of ways so this 208 is a globe ball theyre all 205208 theyre all similar in the sense that theyre balllike yeah similar sizes kind of similar overall shapes this 208 one is a true sphere and it has the globe on it and this i like spinning it like its a globe and thats making thats reminding me of the first time i saw a globe when i was a kid it was one like this 208 that my parents got for us and i just was really intrigued by the fact that the world was there was so much to it you know because you dont know as a kid and i was excited about maybe traveling to some of these places and its smooth it feels the plastic isnt so great i dont really the material of this isnt my favorite out of the bunch but it feels but it feels good and im not sure what you even do with this like what is this you know its what is it i dont really know what it is what youre supposed to do with this thing like the others 205208 are things you could i guess you could play with this 208 and play catch with it or something but im not i dont really understand that 208 one very wellyeah i think thats it wow bead falls ok sorry about that it 212 was the heart its ok i think the heart is not broken which is good alright these are this 209212 little group of objects is extremely interesting to me much more interesting than the than the balls uh this 211 is a a blue plastic liquid filled item that has little blue dolphins inside that look to be swimming in the water its its really interesting to hold its a fun fun item i like playing with it its smooth and  doesnt really have the smell that i i would think it would have it smells interesting like maybe that liquid in there has a scent to it thats kind of nice and it also has some sparkly glitter inside there it has three dolphins and like a seam in the middle and you can kind of like its just interesting what you can do with this thing like now i can touch the dolphins can go from either side oh now my fingers are kind of stuck like one of those chinese finger trap things and this 210 this brain its purple and smooth it has the gyri like a real brain this one reminds me of all the society for neuroscience meetings that ive been to because people would give these out of the booths there at sfn and so i have a few of these around and it just reminds me of that and it feels kind of nice its a little bit like that pink ball 202 was like its like a stress feels good like stress ball i like to squeeze it doesnt have much of a smell like on the signs and stuff so it kind of reminds me of of being there hes cutethis 213216 is interesting so this is a group of four little purses that cant be opened i see that theyre closed for a reason were not supposed to open them they 213216 are filled something with some substance but theres different substances and these 213 two have little feel like hard seeds of some sort or rocks these 215 two um and theyre 213216 made out of like this 215 one is kind of the paisley metallic material blue and pink and yellow designs on it its a little rough on the surface and then theres the the metal portion of the purse and the opener which you cant open you can kind of uh and this one 213 has this ones kind of a reddish pink and has what appear to be butterfly pink butterflies on it and its much smoother material feels nice and soft oh and you can kind of open it and see whats in there i think there are little beans or this 214 one is similar but its black and it has um it has butterflies on it too that are kind of gold and silver and pink and it has a soft substance softer substance inside i dont know whats in there just feels like dirt something like that inside and its this 214 ones smooth these 213 214 two are similar in the in the softness smoothness these 217220 are four little swathes of fabric that are different colored and slightly different sizes theres two 217 220 rectangular more rectangular well this 220 is almost a square almost squares but theyre all pretty different types of material so this 217 one is bright red and and more like felt yeah its a bright red felt material this 220 is a lacy white offwhite kind of embroidered with flowers just piece of material thats got it feels a little rough its got segments that have little holes and then segments that are filled for the pattern so its very different its very different from the red felt 217 one thats just all very the very same throughout and they 217 220 feel very different and then this 218 one is more like a magenta colored square kinda silkier it might even be silk doesnt quite smell like but it might be more like a magenta or maroon magenta square fabric thats softer and smoother than these 217 220 two and then this 219 one is just a piece of like piece piece of fabric that you might use in sewing for something and its got little gold lines within the kind of offwhite background its fraying at the edge lot of them these these 218 219 two are fraying at the edges this 219 one has its got a seam at the one edge with a green line going down and its kind of the material isnt really soft its kind of i dont know how to describe it cotton its like a cotton yeah and if i was to say which one i like of these 217220 the best i think i would say this 220 one its i like the way it feels like if you crumple it it feels its just kind of more manipulable i guess um felt 217 doesnt just doesnt feel as good so yeah i think i like this 220 one the best out of all of them i like the pattern 220 i really dislike this 219 pattern for some reason i dont know why and these 218 217 are just a bit boring these 217 218 two yeahthats it these 221224 are four pieces also of material that are very different from what we saw before and very different from each other these 213216 set of purses reminded me of when i used to go to chinatown in san francisco it just reminds me of the chinese markets there would have little purses like this and so i forgot that that was reminding me of of that umm lets see what else would i want to revisit what were the instructions were to say just describe them and was there anything more to the instructions i dont rememberok great yeah so i think

'116': {'statements': 'ok i dont know i guess not much else is coming to mind yeah i think so ok sure wow so these 205208 are also balltype well type things these 205 207 two i would say are less balllike than like this 208 one is a sphere it has the its like a globe so you have all the continents different countries and oceans and all theres a little dent in it i dont know if thats supposed to be there its a little flat bit its like kind of bouncy not super bouncy but kind of like its like foam i think ok yeah i would say that 201204 one the colors are all kind of like less bright than the colors in this 205208 set very bright and both both 201204 205208 are kind of all the objects are like a somewhat similar size like you dont have anything thats very big or very small im ready for the next one i mean i might come back you know oh well now were going into very different territory well thats kind of cool i feel like theyre 209212 all kind of like biology like you have your i think these 211 are supposed to be dolphins in in this thing i really liked these 211 as a kid and then you have like a heart 212 right well its not like an anatomically correct heart but whatever and an alien 209 which is like or like an alien toy which is a living thing although not from this planet and then a brain 210 um you know its different colors again all 209212 of these are like one color whereas some of the things in the previous set especially the last 205208 one were multicolored whereas this 211 is like blue primarily you have a bit of white and like the eyes are black but like its mostly blue oh and i guess you have like a silver sparkly thing but its all kind of blue toned it 209 has a butt anyway um yeah its 209 an alien less squishy you can kind of bend the limbs but not really then this 212 is hard and then also compared to the previous sets 201208 this 212 is very small whereas like these two 210 211 are bigger and more similar in size to the things in the previous set this ones 209 kind of weird i think yeahyeah i think so sorry about the butt wow this 213216 seems back to kind of a theme going like like the earlier ones 201208 theyre all like the little i think coin or like money purse type things they all 213216 have silver rings i imagine that there would be some out there with gold and theres like a little rubber band thing i think thats so that we cannot open that but im not im not sure different patterns and colors this one 214 you know is black i think like silk or satin something like it with like butterflies on it very pretty i like the butterflies a lot i guess so yeah very obviously these 217220 are all like fabric items all are whats that word quadrilaterals yeah i dont think im not sure like this 218 one seems pretty square this 217 ones a bit more rectangular this 220 one also pretty square well this 219 one too slightly different sizes for all 217220 of them like this 220 one is its a bit rectangular a bit bigger than this 218 one this 218 one is this 219 one is like smaller than the other ones 217 218 220 and this 217 one is kind of a little longer as opposed to tall yes right i can ill lay them out flat thats how you have them no nowell this is kind of like the first two sets 201204 205208 you know like the last two sets 217220 221224 are similar to each other in a way whereas the middle two are just insane what the heck well i guess this 213216 is fabric whatever it appears to be the same way this 221 side is actually quite soft and we see a bit of the like kind of iridescentiness of the fabric and its red i dont know if i mentioned that yet i think so im sure i could think of more things to come up with thats what comes to mind think of i mean i guess maybe like childhood and like being a kid like a lot of these are like toy type of things like these 211 are so fun and then this 212 is like feels like a type of bead or something that you would see with like a kids like jewelry thing this 210 less it feels more like a fidget toy that you get but like this 208 and this 207 and like all of these 201208 like i feel like a lot of people have things like this and like different colors and patterns in elementary school and i think i had something this 202 or quite similar same with these 205 206 probably this 207 too yeah definitely had something like these 211 im sure i got things quite similar to these 213216 as like a souvenir as a kid so yeah i would say that all like reminds me of like childhood these 220 221 two fabrics in particular especially this 221 one feels like something that you would get in like a or like as a halloween costume as a kid or like yeah and this 220 one too less i mean felt 217 obviously used that in like arts and crafts in elementary school um so yeah thats what i would thats what i say i guess like these this 223 especially this one could be like a costume type of thing too yeah i think so ', 'sentence-tokens': ['Ok, I dont know.', 'I guess not much

that ones oh whats this 212 this must be a bead 212 um i cant imagine that it would be a very good bead though it might it could be good bead as an earring because it would hang this way go for it no problemoh good its 211 like a very specific chinese finger trap um the these 209 ones have eyes and i guess this 210 is sort of like a oh these 210 212 are parts of a living thing and these 209 211 are things that are living things um these theyre all theyre 209212 all single colors and um puts 209 through the middle of 211 i think he 209 feels better now smush nice oh the the peekaboo ok ive gotten him 209 stuck were good what was i going to say this 211 ones sparkly are any of the other ones sparkly i dont think they are this 211 one has this one is the only one that has liquid in it i like that it has liquid i like that it is squishy i dont like that i can see fingerprints on it because i imagine lots of other people have touched but its ok i forgive them um i understand that the dolphin tube 211 had a life before it came to me i think this 210 is the most realistic thing that weve gotten so far because i dont know that dolphins 211 are this color hmm i know that aliens 209 have not yet been been proved is real um aside from statistics and if they did i dont imagine they would look just like this 209 might be similar and this 212 is a like approximation oh this is interesting theyre theyre both theyre both very clear like equally vivid representations of a like part of the essential part of the body but this 212 one is symbolic and this 210 one is literal although its 212 like got the the right color this 210 one doesnt have the right color but its clearly more like realistic or clinical or something like that this 210 one also has words on it um christmas colors 209 212 he 209 has heart on his sleeve ooh purses 213216 oh i see we cant open them shaking 214 215 next to ear is it 216 rice i think it rice inside that breaks the dont try to break it rule um are these 213 ones like garbanzo beans or like peas i think theyre maybe peas dried snap peas or something oh youre 215 the same thing but youre 215 less full and i think this 214 is also the rice which ive now broken ok so these 214 216 213 215 ones have the same things inside them these 215 216 both have sparkly shiny reflecty things on the outside and they feel the same except this 216 one has more space thats not sparkly on it so it doesnt have so much of the texture these 213 214 both have the butterfly patterns different colors and this 213 one the butterflies are similarly colored to the background and this 214 one its sort of opposite oh that color is similar i guess same 215 216 same pattern i said this one 215 has a lot more color oh thats interesting this 216 is the pattern same color as background these 216 213 both have that um the the satiny 213 214 ones are much like slicker um and i think i think i like this 215 one the best just aesthetically but i like this these 213 214 ones are much more fun to touch like soft smooth and this 213 is very red i like that 213 umm this 215 one also has yellow these 215 216 both have yellow on it i guess they all 213216 have a little bit of yellow family colors and the um i think all the all the little top parts are the same um now theyre in rainbow order 213 216 215 214 oh and put them in order from most to least full which actually might be how they are already 213 216 215 214  theyve been rainbow ordered in most to least full they 213216 dont like to stand up by themselves oh i think these 213216 are the most useful items weve seen so far practically in everyday life in that they like if i were to like choose something that i would go take out and use for the rest of the day i would choose the dolphins 211 but i should definitely choose the purses 213216 um because they actually have a practical use and the dolphins 211 just fun yeah these 218 219 ones are both soft i guess this 217 ones soft too but dont like it 217 these 218 219 actually feel remarkably similar when im not looking at them these 217 218 ones have the same color same 219 220 color same 218 219 fabric these 219 220 both have little like swirly patterns on them theres a little bit of like shine to the shimmer to the both of them 219 220 this 220 one you can see through this 219 one you cannot see through um this 217 one i guess is sort of translucent you can see the light i guess they all 217220 are in that light maybe this 218 no this one is this 220 reminds me of these 215 216 two like patterny things cause its similar swirly flowery pattern i dont like how theyre 217220 cut because theyre 217220 not cut perfectly actually this 220 one might be the other 217219 ones have begun to fray but thats not their fault or your fault its just its just because theyve 217220 been doing a lot of useful work in the psych department um i wonder yeah i think they 217220 all have an edge that is different im not sure about this 217 one i dont think this 217 one has a  edge um cant imagine wearing any of them 217220 together maybe these two 218 219 these 218 220 ones nice fabricsoh my goodness 221 i think this 221 is my favorite its shiny its shiny and its soft this is like the ultimate sensory seeking fabric picks up 211 oh lets see i dont think i can think of any like underlying connection between all 201224

of the like little purses 213216 as a part of the whole like outfit with accessories and a lot of the things stand alone like the alien 209 and the balls 201208 and i guess the brain 210 but the brain

definitely spiky it has a lot of protrusions that come out of it it makes me feel like these two 201 203 are similar in that way because they both have sort of protrusions that extrude from the center i guess or extrude from the surface this one 202 is by opposite smooth so i would say that these 201 202 are like the opposite of each other because while this extrudes out this one haslacks that basically its 202 completely smooth in texture this one 204 i wanna say materialwise is different these two 202 203 because i think this 202 is like probably silicon rubber or whatnot and this 203 is also probably the same material but this 204 is woven material so it has or like itshow should i saythat it looks more handcrafted than these 201 202 203 three objects um what else what else  i dont know theres some gaps within these objects 203 so again another difference from this 202 because this is completely uniform along the surface whereas this 203 definitely has interruptions on the outside lets see how long am i supposed toso these 205 206 i would automatically sort of group together because they are made of the same material and they have similar color like coloring in that sense although this 205 coloring and this 206 coloring is also evocative of this 208 coloring as well because they sort of borrow from the same color scheme while this 207 is just you know yellow and green by itself um i would say that this 206 one has a lot of interconnected components that whereas we turn to more like pointed extrusions for this 205 toy this 208 is also really smooth and uniform in texture as well and while this 206 is made out of like a rubbery silicon material this 208 definitely feels made out of something less or weaker i wanna say this 207 doesnt seem so solid as these 205 206 208 do by nature of it 207 being made out of like stringy material or whatnot but if uninterrupted then it 207 does take on sort of like a circular shape like the rest of them 205 206 208 essentially but yeah it 207 does have its own extrusions but theyre not as solid it makes it a little bit more loose in that sense or more was it unstable i guess as a toy yeah i would say obviously this 208 one is a similar shape to the pink ball 202 over there this 205 one is very similar to the spiky blue ball 201 over there this 206 one does have gaps and interruptions similar to the the other ball 203 the red blue one and while this 207 one isnt exactly like the hacky sack 204 it seems made out of a much more while that 204 is like made out of like a woven material this 207 also seems like a stringy material so i think thats what i have sorry this 211 is really cool so these 209212 are all i cant really find any similarities among these 209212 toys this 211 one is very soft and it seems to be a very dynamic sort of toy which it sort of moves around and it has components inside of it so thats what i have to say for that 211 this 212 is a lot smaller and its obviously in the shape of a heart its definitely more solid than the first object 211 this 209 is what i assume is a green alien and it has its own unique shape given that its supposed to emulate a sort of object or entity that is well known and this 210 is the shape of the brain its in the purple color and i would say this 210 is sort of like a stress thing and its made out of a very soft material that allows it to compress um so i really cant find many similarities among these many differences no similarities in color no similarities in the structure i would say this 211 is the most fun but other than that i think thats all i have to say theyre all smoothish except for the brain 210 that has some sort of like a rough texture because of the nonuniformity but this 209 is pretty smooth this 212 is pretty smooth this 211 is pretty smooth and bouncy and gellike insidei think thats it so these 214216 are all the same style in the sense that theyre 214216 all the same sort of object i believe like pocket wallets normally for women i would say but obviously not just exclusive to that group and they 213216 all have different designs i would say that these 215 216 two are definitely paired up together and these 213 214 two are paired together the only difference being while they have the same pattern its just different colors so while this 216 has shades of yellow this 215 has red yellow and blue and while this 213 is sort of a red theme for this purse wallet this 214 one is definitely black with some pink and some white and so this is how i would separate it by similarities but obviously the foundation of them 213216 are the same theyre 213216 all the same thing the same object it seems that they 213216 all contain something inside um and because the stitching of these 215 216 two seem more like i dont know well this 213 214 seems more embroidered in a way so its 213 214 not as rough as these 215 216 ones that have probably some sequins or some like extra glittering embellishment to it 215 216 as opposed to these 213 214 ones so like the cloths 217 218 219 220 before this one 221 222 223 224 they 221 222 223 224 all seem to be in a very square rectangularish cut in terms of color these 223 224 are more like the darker black colors this 221 is red and this 222 is white i would say in terms of feel these 221 222 223 three are very soft in texture whereas this 224 ones very rough cause its made out of sort of a mesh material whereas this 221 is probably velvet i wanna say and this 222 one this 222 one is like more of a furish and this 223 is definitely a fur material this 223 is also a case in which theres only one side that has this texture this 224 one has the same texture when you flip it 224 over and this 221 one is different on the other side whereas i think this 222 one is also different from the other side but yeah i would say it reminds me of the cloth 217 218 219 220 only in shape they 217 218 219 220 and 221 222 223 224 do share some similarities in like the red and the white color in that sense but yeah this 224 seems to have a lot of holes in it because its made out of that material this 221 doesnt have any interruptions this 222 doesnt seem to have any interruptions and this 223 doesnt seem to have any interruptions but yes i think thats all on these four they all have i feel like like when you brought them out in groups in certain groups they all have some sort of similarities among them i mean as ive pointed out before so like the first set 201 202 203 204 are all like circularish objects that can be used as like sort of bouncing ballish sort of purposes these 205 206 207 208 are very much more you know typical like toys for children but theyre not you know theyre theyre made to sort of exist you can use it to like play around with it but theyre just there i wanna saythese 209 210 211 212 four are the most like contrasting objects they dont really have a lot to them i think together so these 209 210 211 212 seem a little bit more random as a group and then once we have this 213 214 215 216 these 213224 groups come out they all seem to be of the same or this 213 214 215 216 one seems to be of the same object different pattern this 217224 seems to be of the same shapes just different materials and because with different materials they have different textures to it but i think thats all i have to

I think this 202 is like probably silicon, rubber or whatnot.', 'and this 203 is also probably the same material.', 'but this 204 is woven material so it has or like itshow should I saythat it looks more handcrafted than these 201 202 203 Three objects.', 'Um, what else?', 'What else?', 'I dont know.', 'Theres some gaps within these objects 203.', 'So again, another difference from this 202 because this is completely uniform along the surface, whereas this 203 definitely has interruptions on the outside.', 'Lets see, how long am I supposed toso these 205 206 I would automatically sort of group together because they are made of the same material and they have similar color like coloring in that sense.', 'Although this 205 coloring and this 206 coloring is also evocative of this 208 coloring as well because they sort of borrow from the same color scheme.', 'while this 207 is just you know, yellow and green by itself.', 'Um, I would say that this 206 one has a lot of interconnected components that whereas we turn to more like pointed extrusions for this 205 toy, this 208 is also really smooth and uniform in texture as well.', 'And while this 206 is made out of like a rubbery silicon material, this 208 definitely feels made out of something less or weaker.', 'I wanna say this 207 doesnt seem so solid as these 205 206 208 do.', 'by nature of it 207 being made out of like stringy material or whatnot.', 'But if uninterrupted, then it 207 does take on sort of like a circular shape like the rest of them 205 206 208 essentially.', 'But yeah, it 207 does have its own extrusions, but theyre not as solid.', 'It makes it a little bit more loose in that sense or more.', 'Was it unstable I guess as a toy?', 'Yeah, I would say obviously this 208 one is a similar shape to the pink Ball 202 over there.', 'this 205 one is very similar to the spiky blue Ball 201.', 'Over there.', 'this 206 one does have gaps and interruptions similar to the the other ball 203, the red blue one.', 'And while this 207 one isnt exactly like the Hacky Sack 204, it seems made out of a much more.', 'While that 204 is like made out of like a woven material, this 207 also seems like a stringy material.', 'so I think thats what I have.', 'sorry.', 'This 211 is really cool.', 'So these 209212 are all.', 'I cant really find any similarities among these 209212 toys.', 'This 211 one is very soft and it seems to be a very dynamic sort of toy, which it sort of moves around and it has components inside of it.', 'So thats what I have to say for that 211.', 'This 212 is a lot smaller, and its obviously in the shape of a heart.', 'Its definitely more solid than the first object 211.', 'This 209 is what I assume is a green alien and it has its own unique shape given that its supposed to emulate a sort of object or entity that is well known, and this 210 is the shape of the brain.', 'Its in the purple color and I would say this 210 is sort of like a stress thing and its made out of a very soft material that allows it to compress.', 'Um, so I really cant find many similarities among these many differences.', 'No similarities in color, no similarities in the structure.', 'I would say this 211 is the most fun, but other than that, I think thats all I have to say.', 'Theyre all smoothish except for the brain 210 that has some sort of like a rough texture because of the nonuniformity.', 'but this 209 is pretty smooth.', 'This 212 is pretty smooth.', 'This 211 is pretty smooth and bouncy and gellike insidei think thats it.', 'So these 214216 are all the same style in the sense that theyre 214216 all the same sort of object I believe, like pocket wallets normally for women, I would say, but obviously not just exclusive to that group.', 'And they 213216 all have different designs.', 'I would say that these 215 216 two are definitely paired up together.', 'and these 213 214 two are paired together.', 'The only difference being while they have the same pattern, its just different colors.', 'So while this 216 has shades of yellow, this 215 has red, yellow, and blue.', 'And while this 213 is sort of a red theme for this purse wallet, this 214 one is definitely black with some pink and some white.', 'And so this is how I would separate it by similarities.', 'But obviously the foundation of them 213216 are the same.', 'Theyre 213216, all the same thing, the same object.', 'It seems that they 213216 all contain something inside.', 'Um, and because the stitching of these 215 216 two seem more like, I dont know.', 'Well, this 213 214 seems more embroidered in a way.', 'So its 213 214, not as rough as these 215 216 ones that have probably some sequins or some like extra glittering embellishment to it 215 216 as opposed to these 213 214 ones.', 'So like the cloths 217 218, 219 220 before this one, 221 222, 223 224 they 221 222, 223 224 all seem to be in a very square, rectangularish cut.', 'In terms of color, these 223 224 are more like the darker black colors.', 'This 221 is red and this 222 is white.', 'I would say in terms of feel, these 221 222 223 three are very soft in texture whereas this 224 ones very rough cause its made out of sort of a mesh material whereas this 221 is probably velvet I wanna say.', 'And this 222 one, this 222 one is like more of a furish and this 223 is definitely a fur material.', 'This 223 is also a case in which theres only one side that has this texture.', 'This 224 one has the same texture when you flip it 224 over and this 221 one is different on the other side, whereas I think this 222 one is also different from the other side.', 'But yeah, I would say it reminds me of the cloth 217 218, 219 220 only in shape.', 'They 217 218 219 220 and 221 222 223 224 do share some similarities in like the red and the white color in that sense.', 'But yeah, this 224 seems to have a lot of holes in it because its made out of that material.', 'This 221 doesnt have any interruptions.', 'This 222 doesnt seem to have any interruptions and this 223 doesnt seem to have any interruptions.', 'But yes, I think thats all on these four.', 'They all have.', 'I feel like like when you brought them out in groups.', 'In certain groups, they all have some sort of similarities among them.', 'I mean, as Ive pointed out before, so Like the first set, 201, 202, 203, 204 are all like circularish objects that can be used as like sort of bouncing ballish sort of purposes.', 'These 205, 206, 207, 208 are very much more.', 'You know, typical like toys for children.', 'but theyre not.', 'You know, theyre theyre made to sort of exist.', 'You can use it to like play around with it, but theyre just there.', 'I wanna saythese 209 210, 211, 212 Four are the most like contrasting objects.', 'They dont really have a lot to them, I think together.', 'So these 209 210, 211 212 seem a little bit more random as a group.', 'And then once we have this 213, 214, 215 216 these 213224 groups come out.', 'They all seem to be of the same.', 'Or this 213, 214, 215 216 one seems to be of the same object, different pattern.', 'This 217224 seems to be of the same shapes, just different materials.', 'And because with different materials, they have different textures to it.', 'But I think thats all I have to say.']}, '119': {'statements': 'no just nerves but well seeman thats a long

the more we need to keep it going so i can touch them201 lights up ooh i like that 201 ok this 202 is rough here these 201 203 here feel the same to me i mean theyre not rough theyre not hard this 204 is real soft its softer than these 201 203 this 202 is the hard one thats really different to me from these 201 203 and that 204 so what do you thinkto me this 201 one is different to me because like i said its not hard it lights up this 203 is remind me of something that stick to the wall you see what im sayingthis 204 to me feel like something might be like a pin cushion like stick some pins or something in it this 202 is some throw on the floor like on you know bounce ball or cause it aint nothing i can do like this with it so thats really different i would say this 202 kind of ball people probably use in a you know how people throw them balls in you know what im sayingyeah yeah something in sports yeah yeah this kind of ball you i say you would use in sports or something ok but these 201 203 like i said this this 201 different because im because it light up and it feels spiky and this 203 one here remind me of something like stick to the wall you can throw it it might stick to the wall but theyre 201 203 softer theyre 201 203 soft but this 204 to me is like something you might stick some pins in i notice that the colors this 203 is multicolored this 201 just one color like i said light up i got that thats 201 different from all of them i think thats about it but i would id stick some pins in this 204 a needle you know like people use stick pins when they sewing or something you might use this 204 for that thats just my opinion i probably use it 204 for thatthats itok this 205 like playing jacks here you know because thats what it 205 reminds me of like some jacks you throw mimes throwing jacks ok this is like this 208 is another soft ball but it look like a globe it looks like a globe  stuff this 206 here i would say ive seen this 206 before but ive seen people wear this like bracelets on they arms but i dont know what they use it for i really dontyou know you could use a lot with this if it had a part to hang on there this 207 feels fine though its 207 ok though this 207 the softest thing up here this 207 right here to me and this 208 is like  would be goodyou know for a hand exercise like i said this 205 remind me of some jacks i dont know what these 205 206 are used for but they colorful i like the colors in it colorful i think thats iti hope i dont fail come on but you know what i could i could say one more thing about that 208 globe although now i just think for somebody looking for something on the map or something theyd probably look at that ball and say you know what i can find this on this 208 balloh my god jesus help me this 210 somebody brain here ok we got a heart 212 up here hes 209 a alien this 211 here i see kids with this i dont know what this for but they have a well this is kind of something interesting cause you got fish in it you got glitter in it and i think whats in it kids love it they like to see whats in it its moving you know what im sayingits 211 something they play with but this 210 remind me of somebodys brain right here this really do and the heart oh everybody got a good heart some people do some people dont they could make a necklace out of it 212 if they wanted to but this 209 is an alien im gonna go say he 209 a alien  okthats itoh my god all these little toys 201212 jesusnot really because like this one 206 here id never seen but it reminds me of little kids or even adults have like necklace you know these bracelets on there armsthat 206 kind of remind me of that but its just twisted wrapping hands around in twisting motion you know you know what im sayingyeah but its all gathered together but yeah they rest stuff like that on their arms i could be wrong like i said this 202 a bounce ball so some people throw that use for sports ok oh i saw these 213216 little purses yesterday in the lab room after a different participant had gone i said they 213216 just so cute ok theyve 213216 got stuff in them do i have to know whats in themto me in person my opinion when the person gives me a coin purse is because they want me to keep my change in it so i dont have to be putting it all in my purse thats what i think about coin purses you know they could be any color any size to me but i like corn purses period but this is what i would use them for coin purses yeahand they all different this 215 one this one here feels like like you got a million dollars in it this 216 one too this 213 is just these 213 214 are silky like you know like a silk material this 215 216 is more like a more rough i dont know what you call this material most indians to me have on stuff like this kind of a pattern thats what i think indians wear this kind of pattern a lot thats the only thing i see difference in them here come the hard stuffthis is the real test uh ohoh my god do you know what im thinking right now of this 217220my grandmother used to sew patterns like this together into quiltsand thats what came to my mind when i saw this 217219 really because we could go get her pieces of old clothing and things like that and it didnt matter what it was it could be felt taps 217 it could be cotton taps 218 219 she used it all to make quilts cause i got quilts right now that my grandmother made theyre beautiful too this what this reminds me of putting these things together arranges 217219 into a square sewing them together and making quilts i dont know about no bedspread or no curtains somebody might make some curtains with this 220you see what im saying because to me this 220 remind me of they might put this together make some curtains to go on the window but this 219 here to me this is something you sew together or you can use this 217 between different things that you make like in a quilt yeah thats what i think of that stuff thats ituh oh im gonna fail definitely i would sew that 220 to make curtains that 220 look like a curtain pattern to me im good girl hush your mouththese 222 223 im thinking about a rug on the flooryeah thats what im thinking about rug on the floor 222 223 this 224 here to me look like what they used to call things you put potatoes in like sacks thats what remind me of that 224 and this 221 here i dont know people just wear this in so many ways you know i dont know if you can then take it and make a covering with it on like a couch or chair or something you could use it 221 like a covering or something or they could

theyre all 201204 squishy at some level of squishiness trying to think what else i should describe on those 201204 im probably missing something very very general but i cant really think of anything elsenot quite what i was anticipating on a linguistics study this is interesting alright um not as much of a ball shape on all of these 205208 oh what are these 207 called these 207 used to be a big thing way back when but i cant think what this 207 is called i dont know ok now thats gonna bother me its escaping me and now im a little uh whats it called all right so one 208 we have a globe

have larger segments i guess of plastic thats being woven in between them uh one 205 is very starbursty kinda shaped the other one 206 is more ball shaped its just driving me nuts i saw it 207 and im like ooh wait crudso ok thats all i have for these 205208 interesting 209212 ok now were definitely getting away from the ball shape foam purple brain 210 with writing on it 210 stress ball this 212

know a cuff i dont really know how to describe that 211 with dolphins in it and fluid in it there are three dolphins in there it 211 is made of plastic and it 211 is yeah a goofy childs toy that i cant seem to hold on to i think thats the point buthmmi think sofabric purses 213216 im guessing im not supposed to open these they 213216 are all filled with different types of beads different sizes of beads they 213216 are four different colors red 213 gold 216 black 214 multicolor 215 mainly blue and yellow they 213216 are also different levels of being filled one 213 is almost entirely full or 213 feels mainly full with larger beads this 215 one is probably less than half full with medium beads this 216 feels like its filled with sand or sand type material and then this 214 one has really tiny beads in it also 214 is maybe half full cute little purses 213216 thats all i gotsure alright four 217220 different types of materials although these 218 219 feel very similar um different colors 213216 so we have two 218 219 knit and guessing this 219 is linen this 218 is acrylic or cotton im guessing theyre all kind of acrylic but 218 maroon color we have a felt red rectangle 217 this 218 ones mainly a square thats 219 a square thats 220 a square so one 217 rectangle three 218220 squares um this 220 is more of a lace type of material in white sparkly sparkly white and then this 219  is like a cotton linen material that is white with gold inlay and yeah just a normal felt 217 rectangle and a maroon square 218 also fabric im guessing this 218 is polyester or cotton im not 100 sure i think thats everything i have on those yepsorry i have a habit of holding things if its foldablecool alright well we have a velvet 221 dark red velvet square a fuzzy 223 animal skinesque faux animal print not print sorry animal fur i should say square this 224 looks like a canvas black square i should also note the animal fur 223 is black something 224i dont quite know what this 224 material is 224 feels canvasy and then we have a faux 222 wool like white rectangle very soft the the wool 222 is the most soft and probably save then the faux fur 223 then the velvet 221 then the canvas 224 canvas 224 is the most rough of the four 221224 um i would note the wool 222 is also the thickest of the four 221224 then the fur 223 then the canvas 224 then the velvet 221 and thats all i got cool howd i doa lot of interesting different types of materials for sure i dont think i can really think of am i missing something ok yeah nothing i can really think of i guess maybe the different types of

conceivably throw at someone at or with another person without injuring them hacky sack 204 fun 204 ive never seen one of these 203 before its almost like suction cuppy i feel like these 201 203 two are more similar and these 202 204 two are more similar because these 201 203 have protrusions on them and because im sort of unfamiliar with them 201 203 this 201 might be something that you would use to like roll out your back i think this 202 is a racquetball its not a lacrosse ball but its very similar theres similar size but a lacrosse ball is heavier and its it has more to give to it but this 202 is i mean this is maybe the hardest object squishing each object in terms of squishiness and then this 204 is kind of the softest how much more detail should i go into ok ok in terms of color and texture these 201 203 two are also more similar than and then i think these 202 204 two would go in distinct groups this 204 is like i feel like this like texture makes me think of like camp as like a kid yeah and obviously this 202 makes me think of lacrosse because its very like a lacrosse ball i did have pink ones but i lost them oh not yeah theyre theyre fun for a time they were very distinctive but definitely not a lacrosse ball it 202 might just be like a toy for kids actually i dont even know if it qualifies as a racquetball i have to wonder what this 203 is i guess this 203 might be something you find in like a grabber machine or something ok thats all im particularly have to say about thoseyeah that 202 one doesnt wanna stay now i see why theres an instruction not to eat them because this 205 looks like something you should chew on and this 206 too like these 205 206  seem like things that you could give to like a baby for teething kind of i mean theyre 205 206 probably not that but they could be this 207 also makes me think of like something that you would get out of like like a grabber machine at like a bowling alley its like the kind of thing that like my younger brother would have that is like absolutely what is this 207 its 208 a little bit dented globe i wonder how accurate this 208 is i wonder if you have to make sacrifices in accuracy when youre putting it on the ball im truly just saying everything that pops in oh theres like a little bit of a tiny bit of a rip there squeezing 208 kind of a sound of air going out of it in terms of texture its more similar to the pink ball 202 than anything but of these 205208 these 205 207 are both spiky these 206 208 are both solely round service surfaces but obviously these 205 206 two are much more alike than either of those 207 208 two are to either of these 205 206 or to each other 207 208 these 205 206 are very much make me think of like baby chewy toys are these stars 205 yeah they are oh and these are stars 206 too but theyre just round kind of sticky 205 206 not like very sticky but just like like in terms of plastic theyre just sticky like that i dont think theres anything on them get thereyesoki love him 209 i love aliens i have like ive had multiple pairs of socks with aliens on them and multiple little aliens that sit in my room i love this 209 guy hes i cant tell what this 209 has to be plastic ok hes 209 bendier than i thought he would be i wonder where this 209 is from oh theres little things on his back i wonder if hes supposed to like stand up as part of a set and another thing 211 that my little brother would get from like a bowling alley somewhere yeah we like would like keep these 211 in the car as sometimes like for my brothers to play with because they would always like pick them up from like i dont even know where they got them oh my god my fingernails are gonna get stuck in there 211 i put these fingernails on this morning and i already snapped one off dolphins 211 cute 211 i have to wonder if the liquid inside must just be colored water because i feel like anything else is not child safe and all of these 209212 are definitely things well i wouldnt give this 212 to a child because thats a choking hazard and he 209 might be a choking hazard too but everything else is something that i would feel comfortable giving to a child these 211 212 are similar in that both of them have glitter other than that im not comfortable saying that anything in this category 209212 is particularly similar to each other other than that its a small like small object that is a trinket of sorts but in terms of texture i mean other than all of them 209212 being potentially plastic and generally pretty smooth although this 210 is ridged i mean theyre 209212 all like smoothish plastic but these 209212 dont appear like visually similar to me in most other waysyes oh i had some of these 213216 as a kid i dont know if i had any of these like patterns i might have had one that was this 213 pattern or it was like red with something gold on it but yeah i definitely had one of these 213216 as a kid oh my god i forgot that these existed i guess they i mean in terms of color theyre 213216 all the same purse but in different colors these 214 215 two are darker colors these 213 216 two are bright vivid primary colors although this 216 has sort of an odd greenish undertone to it but i would definitely say that this 216 is gold especially because the gold embroidery but its because of that these 215 216 two are more texturally similar because they have more of the embroidery or patterning on them that makes them a little bit rougher to the surface and then these 213 214 ones are similar in that they have a similar type of pattern its 213 214 not exactly the same pattern but they no its not the same pattern but they 213 214 both have moths of the similar design on them and so theres more smooth surface you can feel although i feel like the red one 213 has a slightly different texture and whats inside them 213216 is different these 213 215 two have the same thing inside them these 214 216 two have the same thing inside them huh the moths 213 214 are both pink and brown i think its just harder to tell because the pink on the red 213 ok yes put them up thereok all 217220 pieces of fabric of approximately similar size and dimensions this 219 is more square than these two 218 219 are square this 219 one is smaller this 218 one is larger this one 220 is approximately square somewhat rectangular and this 217 one is definitively rectangular and makes no pretension of being square this 220 almost makes me think of like a wedding dress or something like the white like lace like somebodys like a piece of somebodys like veil this 217 is felt like craft project felt this 218 im not sure exactly what kind of fabric this 218 is maybe its some type of like linen or something i dont really know fabrics but its 218 definitely more frayed than the other ones around the edges and then this 219 one is also slightly more frayed its feels texturally similar to this 218 but this 218 is a little bit thicker and sturdier and this 219 is lighter this 219 is like the kind of fabric that my grandmother who does like embroidery and has like a sewing machine actually sews has because it 219 has this like strip on the edge yeah its just a lot of like gold pattern detailing with also some like somewhat darker prints so in that in terms of like visual patterning these 219 220 two are similar and these 217 218 two are similar because these 217 218 are reddish shades but in terms of material these 218 219 are the most similar and these 217 220 two are different and i guess all of these 217219 are opaque and this 220 is a light mostly seethrough material yeah ok thats allok more fabric 221224 oh this 224 is like a potato sack but its 224 black im trying to decide what color it 224 is because if you put it out like this holds

believe a hacky sack but maybe im aging myself and its covered in a knit colorful covering thats red green yellow and black definitely  and theres clearly something inside which is different than all

different orange yellow and blue color this 205 looks like its comprised of stars five point stars put together to make a ball drops 205 on table bounces slightly 205 i can tell how this 205 was put together because you can see little parts that are connected this 206 does not have points these shapes also look like stars actually five points but they are rounded and i also can see the joints where i think they get connected  they were joined together and im guessing holds 205 and 206 this 206 one bounces higher hard to tell very similar ok so were out of balls now were on to  very different shapes this 212 one in a way is the most simplistic its the shape of a heart there it looks to be a center that maybe it could be strung like a necklace string looks like its maybe blown glass perhaps it has like a metallic center and it looks fragile i cant bounce it these 213216 are similar looking small coin purses that are all similar in that theyre embroidered in slightly different ways i can see that theyre 213216 all closed with a rubber band which probably just telling me not to open them so this 214 one is black with butterflies that are copper and pink feels like there are some this feels like a bean bag so im not sure what the contents are that fill a bean bag soft 214 lifts each of 213216 one of the lightest 214 but probably not the lightest this 213 has is similar patterned in that its 213 also butterflies but on a red satin background there are larger dried beans inside 213 so it has a little bit of a rougher feel and its 213 heavier than the black one 214 this 216 yellow one is a different pattern but most similar to the blue 215 in that its gold theres a shine to it also white pattern paisley repeating hard to tell whats inside 216 maybe rice something a little bit smaller than i think either of the other two 213 214 but its fairly full this 215 blue is filled less completely similar paisley pattern but with more vibrant colors theres blue yellow a little bit of gold and red and this 215 feels perhaps like it has the same beans in it as the red one 213 although less fullso another set 221224 of four fabrics also cut in either square or

at walls to stick to things but not necessarily like one specific game or use for it same thing with like this 201 one and then this 202 bouncy one i think as far as like similarities go you know obviously the general shape 201204 textures different use for the most part is gonna be similar but i wouldnt not the exact same yeah i think thats all that initially comes to mind yeah i mean i think initially texture is like the first thing i would notice with the exception i take it back this 204 one only because this 204 i like very much associate with one use and then the other three 201 202 203 its kind of more like texture related for me and then i think thats it reallyso four more balls 205208 this 208 one is like the tiniest globe ive ever seen not a lot of detail a little bit but again like sort of stress ball feel to it 208 this 207 like very much reminds me of toys that i had growing up i couldnt tell you like exactly what just like very weird vague memories of like something with this kind of texture for hair and googly eyes um so definitely this 207 one is like of all of them the most like nostalgic for me these two are pretty similar in their like material and color compositions pushes 208 and 207 on the table this 207 does not roll these 205 206 guys do sort of kind of mostly yeah this 205 one seems like its got a bunch of stars together whereas this 206 has maybe flower type shapes it 206 does make me kind of curious about how they got them all tangled and like that like the process of making it 205 versus like this 207 seems pretty obvious i guess i wonder this 205 almost looks like it could glow in the dark which is kind of could be cool yeah thats it for this group this 210 is obviously a stress ball type of thing that you could get at any kind of like career fair job fair some kind of marketing material yeah for title company 210 a brain is an interesting choice im not really sure what it doesnt really tell me about what their company is like i dont know immediately im like this is obviously marketing though like everybody now i dont know younger generations are all just trying to reinvent the wheel just give them these things 211 or those crazy guys that like make sound when you move them motions rotating hand you know as a group 209212 theyre all like kind of i again this 209212 is like a group of things with the exception of this 211 guy this 209 210 212 is all stuff that would be in like a junk drawer in my house with like oh like this 209 was fun when i got it from the little vending thing and then its like entertaining for twenty minutes and then put somewhere else and forgotten about soall 209212 pretty vibrant colors i dont know if id say this 210 is vibrant but yeahfour little coin purses im assuming youre not supposed to open them 213216 right ok so four swatches of fabric 217220 one 217 is red felt another 218 just some kind of like probably like synthetic synthetic red something and then another piece 219 of some kind of fabric and then 220 some kind of lacy fabric theyre 217220 all about the same size cut this 220 is a little bigger in general all 217220 about the same size cut you could use them to um make lots of things you could use them 217220 together you could use them separately yeah theyre 217220 all roughly the same size different materials id say probably similar uses felt 217 i think is a little more like craftfriendly for like kids crafts and stuff glue it to stuff whereas a lot of this 218 219 220 is a little more like you would probably use this for a sewing project of some sort what else youve got like kind of two reds 217 218 and two like white offwhite type colors 219 220 yeah this 220 ones got like a little bit of a shine to it yeah i think thats all i have to say about thatok so four more swatches 221224 of sort of fabric type material theres like a velvet a im not even sure what this 222 would be called like kind of a sort of like a plush like mock sheepskin kind of 222 good for things moccasins like the insides of shoes or slippers um very soft and warm 222 the velvet 221 pretty red velvet 221 you can use it 221 for all sorts of like dresses or sort of ornamental things this 224 is a kind of a burlap material id say like a black burlap 224 it 224 kind of reminds me of a place mat but i think thats because i have place mats that are kind of this 224 material it 224 seems like it wouldnt absorb a lot of water this 222 probably would this 221 i dont think would absorb too much and this 223 is like some kind of shag black shag thing again this 221224 whole this 221224 grouping reminds me of stuff that my mom would have used to make a halloween costume for me like the year i was a werewolf or the year i was like some kind of elf something whereas this 217220 group is a little bit more like i dont want to say functional cause like this 222 i could see you using on using for something like slippers or some whatever but yeah this 223 kind of reminds me of a rug that would be a nightmare to vacuum but again two 223 224 similar colors these 221 222 are not close in color at all again similar sizes 221224 of fabric kind of remind me of what you would get out of the section of joann fabrics thats like the leftover section that we used to get when we were little and go look joannes to like find some kind of craft to do yeah i think thats about iti think initially like the first two groups 201204 205208 were spheres balls of some kind so it was a little surprise and then this 209212 group seemed to make more sense with this 201208 and then the coin purses 213216 kind of surprised me a little bit because it was a little like a different kind of general grouping and then the same with the fabric and then the fabrics 217224 were kind of their own so it was almost like three different types of groups like balls i dont really know i dont know where to put this 209212 when i like conceptualize and then fabrics overall yeah i think i like can associate each item with like some part of like my childhood sort oflike the balls are obviously like games with balls these 209212 are like again sort of like the tchotchke type thing that we would get like in i dont know a restaurant vending machine thing my grandmother had a bunch of coin purses that shed like yeah give us and then wed put some random

so far this 201 is the first one that caught my eye and then this 204 is also a little bit squishy but firmer multicolored 204 it 204 seems to have some sort of like cultural maybe significance but im not sure yeah this 203 one kind of similar actually this one is like kind of the same like bluish color 201 i feel like umm and its 203 also multicolored same size as these 201 204 two and yeah fun to this 203 ones definitely fun to touch and then this 202 one seems to be different from like the rest of them probably because its just like pink and lighter and definitely a lot firmer than the other ones 201 203 204 but this 202 i feel like its what i recognize the most in comparison to the others 201 203 204 the others 201 203 204  i feel like i wouldnt be able to like identify but yeah this 202 one just feels like almost like a lacrosse ball but like not really and yeah this 202 one is the only one that has text on it which is kind of interesting and lets see is that too littleyeah i think thats good alright quick question can i talk about like the next set of all things like in relation to those ooh ok so immediately what stands out these 205 206 two are very similar to each other and they kind of like shiny maybe like i feel the texture is kind of interesting because its almost like it like looks like it could be gelatinous kind of but theyre 205 206 definitely more like rubbery i guess to the touch they 205 206 seem to have like yeah similar sets of colors this 205 one is definitely more spiky kind of like that 201 one i feel like sorry the blue one while this 206 one that reminds me of like that 203 other spherical one and this 206 one kind of looks like like an atom to me does that make senseumm and then this 208 is obviously representative of the globe and its 208 a lot squishier than i than i thought it 208 would be but the colors also seem to be like similar to these 205 206 two in terms of like the pink and the orange and the blue because it has to be more like vibrant colors and this 208 kind of like i feel like if i were to compare these two groups 201204 205208 i think that this 208 one would be like the most similar to this 202 in terms of just like the way that it like feels and looks just in terms of shape and then yeah this 207 is also kind of fun its 207 obviously yellow and green but the the way it 207 feels is pretty different compared to like everything ive felt so far like it 207 doesnt really seem to have a like a shape to it its 207 kind of more just like whatever you want it to be but yeah and then yeah and i think that like for some reason like this 207 one didnt even like stand out that much when i first received this set 205208 because i was just looking at these 205 206 two and like how similar they 205 206 were but yeah this 207 one kind of like looking back on it this 207 one i feel like its definitely like different from the rest 205 206 208 and its 207 more fun to touch i think ok im ready for the next fourok these 209212 are really interesting im loving this 209 one this 209 one is definitely going to  i actually did not know i couldnt even recognize that this 210 was a brain at first i thought it 210 was just like a round thing but yeah 210 seems to be an interesting color too i feel like i havent really seen this color yet and especially i wouldnt like associate this purple color with a brain anyways so yeah its 210  like squishy and kind of like fun to touch like the other ones and yeah i think that these 2019212 are the most like recognizable objects so far like this whole set 209212 because this 212 is like a shape that i can recognize this 210 is like a organ that i can recognize and an alien 209 obviously and then i like just noticed the the sharks 211 or not the sharks oh my god the dolphins yeah i feel like this 211 like feels so familiar to me but i dont know where its 211 from like i feel like ive like played with something like this 211 as a kid and i really like the glittery kind of component to it 211 and the fact that it 211 can just like move like its 211 not like like a set shape really like it 211 reminds me of like a waterbed or something but yeah i think that these 209212 are definitely the most different in terms of like what they appear to be and also the colors like theyre 209212 instead of being like multicolor they 209212 seem to be more just like one color for each object or like one dominant color for each object and yeah i really like this 209 this alien one though this 212 seems to be the smallest object so far out of everything ive seen and this 212 also feels like familiar like this 212 feels like it could belong to like a necklace or something and yeah ok yeah ooh ok this felt like a very like familiar to me when i saw all of them 213216 like i feel like ive seen all these 213216 in like a store before like these exact designs interesting ok so these 214 215 two are like a little bit lighter i think this 213 ones definitely i really like this 213 one just because i feel like it 213 has like a bit more like cultural significance like cause like red is like a lucky color in like chinese culture so i feel like this 213 one like stood out to me the most and this 215 this 215 one is really interesting like its like shiny but also but its 215 not like too like its 215 not like overwhelmingly shiny but i kind of like how theyre all like they all seem to be like the same size yeah i think that like these 215 216 two are kind of fun to look at just because its like interesting colors and this 215 one is multicolored and this 216 one is like a specific color of yellow that i like havent really seen a lot with these types of bags and pouches um yeah i dont think i have like too much else to say besides that but i definitely if i were to like group these two together because i feel like i tend to just like group them together within the sets that these 215 216 two would probably go together and like these 213 214 two ok im done with this oneok yeah this 217220 is definitely like the the biggest set of objects so far again i would probably group like this 217 218 set and then this 219 220 set together if i had to but yeah i think the first thing i noticed really was that like this 218 is like a little bit like its kind of like tapered off i guess or like theres some threads that are like just hanging outside and then 217 this one also kind of has some like noticeable like white threads here and there that like make it a little bit more like not distracting but just like different i guess and then these 219 220 seem a lot more like uniform because of probably just like the pattern the color i really like this 219 texture and then like ive had like something similar to this 219 on like a pillow pillowcase maybeand then this 220 is like this 220 is like meshy this almost reminds me of like a dress fabric kind of or wedding dress fabric i really like this 218 shade of i dont know if its like like maroonish or like burgundy but i really like this 218 color i actually love how these 217 218 colors like kind of go with the the like lighter whiter colors 219 220 again like red 217 sort of always stands out to me because of the cultural thing but i feel like this 217 texture too i dont know if i like where i would feel this 217 kind of texture but its 217 definitely a lot more like clothy like something i feel like i would find in art classroom versus like in everyday life yeah ok nice ok yeah i feel like this 221224 gives like a completely different like energy to versus like that set 217220 because like 221224 we have kind of like darker colors we have more interesting textures like this 223 one seems more like furnish and like this 224 feels a bit rougher like it 224 doesnt feel like it could belong to like a dress or something maybe like furniture it 224 feels a little bit more like worn and used and then like this 221 pattern is really like velvety i really love this 221 type of like color with this uh with this texture because it 221 reminds me of just like like velvet couches or something kind of like mysterious i would love this 221 like on a dress for example and yeah i really like this 221 kind of like with those 218 217 colors as well like the maroonish 218 and reddish 217 colors and i also this 222 is like really soft i just love like touching this 222 i also feel like theres this like interesting like black thread here thats just been like caught up in the mix yeah but i feel like this 222 one has also been kind of like used just based off of like the little like black specks here and there and threads and i also feel like these 221224 are like slightly bigger than that 217220 set even though they like look like a similar size i feel like its just like getting bigger and bigger yeah i also notice how theyre 221224 like all similar shapes like kind of like not a perfect square or anything but just like the same like ratio of like rectangle like thing with but yeahready for the last setoh got it got itthe first that 201204 was the first set right or ok i feel like yeah i feel like the objects kind of became like a lot more like close in similarity either in terms of like color or in terms of like the actual you know shape and like function i guess that as the sets kept coming yeah and it was much easier trying to detect the like differences in these earlier sets i feel like just based off of the appearance um compared to these 217224 which were like slightly more similar i guess in terms of like the way it felt and just comparing these

also its 202 dense but not hard this 204 one is probably filled with little beans very squishy 204 fabric outside would not bounce this 201 one looks like my dogs toy can i pull this off pulls a hair off 201 sorry that was bothering me does it 201 like ooh it might have little light ups drops 201 on table and it lights up yes it lights up i knew it blue outside 201 its interesting that the light inside is blue and red i dont know why but i think that they use the same color on the inside as the outside is kind of interesting its 201 spikey i dont think i mentioned that yet i feel like these 203 look like little suction cups on the end but i dont think it 203 would actually stick no its it doesnt actually do that green blue and red 203 i mean i wouldnt call it 203 spiky but the outside round part is made up of spikes with like soft pads on the ends maybe it would bounce these 201 202 two will bounce this 204 one will not bounce 203 does not bounce but also doesnt stick sono ok cool ok cool these 205 206 two are very similar theyre made up of like the same rubber no plastic solidified glue i dont know whatever it is and then theyre 205 206 very colorful this 205 one looks like

actually like focused on one of them this 208 is a globe but its small and squishy small and squishyprobably foam 208 yeah i think so i loved these 207 when i was a kid i dont know i had a purple one yeah but it was bigger than this 207 it was like pretty big it was it was like this big yeah it was really big and these were stretchier on the one i had like you could pull it like out like all the way like this these pulls strings on 207 are not that stretchy but its 207 soft and its green and yellowok long silence while holding 211 well come back to that 211 one alien 209 his arms stay when you move them thats kind of cool hes 209 kind of smiling this is first position bends legs second position maybe hes 209 a ballerina maybe its a she hes 209 green i guess he i dont know if my head hes a he green alien 209 hard 209 brain 210 from druthers purple squishy foam 210 like the globe 208 its the same material 208 210 this 208 one probably also has yeah the little seam this 210 one has it too yes this 212 is a bead taps 212 with fingernail plastic red 212 kind of sparkly though the like the little thing inside it 212 is sparkly but the outside part is not places 212 on table hard and i still dont know whats going on with this 211 guy i am confused by this one its this it like movesand little dolphins that are kind of cute but were also a little bit creepy when i didnt know what they were at first oh theres some glitter inside it 211 it 211 rollsbut like a cylinder rolls whereas the other ones were rolling like balls roll oki guess so theyre 213216 purses but like very nicely made and fancy and pretty purses i dont these are their clutches right i dont know i think so i dont know very much about bags i dont i dont use them much i have a backpack this 215 is a pretty like paisleyesque pattern i dont know if thats the right word for it but the base 215 is like a purple or blue and then its got yellow and reddish on it gold some gold lining its 215 very pretty but theres kind of a lot going on in the pattern its 215 a its a little bit busy this 214 one is the same theyre 213216 all the same shape theyre like of all of the things youve given me so far these 213216 are all the most similar to each other because they have the same shape theyre 213216 the same object different colors and fabrics this 214 one is black with butterflies different colored butterflies red 213 with all pink butterflies this 216 ones a paisley pattern like the other one 215 but it 216 doesnt feel like theres as much going on cause its kind of one color its all shades of yellow and gold this 216 ones heavier than all the other ones 213215 though this 215 ones really light this 216 ones very heavy arranges left to right 215 213 214 216 no backwards changes arrangement to 215 214 213 216 there we go lightest 215 to heaviest 216 this 217 is felt its 217 red felt is pretty soft i dont know though also kind of scratchy i think it 217 wont fold as well as the other fabric this 219 is pretty normal fabric yeah the front 219 has pattern and then the back like you dont really see the pattern because its been printed on i dont know what the pattern 219 is its just lines in gold and purple but i cant see a picture and its 219 clearly the edge because its has the flat edge not cuti wanna call this 220 lace but it its like not even though it its 220 like cheap craft store lace i mean yeah i dont know well call it 220 lace i can call it 220 lace its also see cause its 220 not even white though its like silver its sparkles i think even without the sparkles i dont know if it 220 would be white i think its silver this 218 is also plain fabric but its been dyed not printed cause the back is the same color as the front or i guess there is no front if theyre the same this 218 one also looks like it has one of the edges the rest of the edges 218 are kind of frayed like the other one 219 its 218 a pretty maroon color kinda red we just learned this but i cant remember it its like hamr arabic word i dont know its something like thatright those are i guess thats what ill say about the fabrics oh wow this 222 was a lot softer than i thought it would be when i put my hand on it i thought it 222 yeah i dont know its 222 very soft its 222 kind of like sherpa but even softer than that or maybe the sherpa i have just is not soft white and its 222 fuzzy the back is like also incredibly and surprisingly soft even though its not the actual like soft side 222 has a lot of threads from the other fabric on it this 221 is like velour my grandmother made me a dress in this 221 color and fabric when i was young that i wore to the like father daughter dance with my dad every year yes i dont thats like what this makes me think of its 221 very deep red velour yeah this 224 is like a weave kinda scratchy its its 224 kind of close to like canvas i dont know how else to describe it its black this 223 is also black fake fur 223 its not that soft and the back of this 223 one is not soft at all i dont know why the somehow they made the back of this 222 one very soft i dont know the two sets 201208 at the beginning and the two sets 217224 at the end are very similar to each other and then two 209216 in the middle are just kind of hanging out yeah yeah the first and second sets 201208 are similar to each other and the last 221224 and the penultimate 217220 i dont know cause like one two three four five the fifth and the sixthyes yeah yes the fifth 217220 and the sixth 221224 are similar to each other and then the two 209216 in the middle are just kind of chillingthat 209212 one is the most confusing all the other ones have some kind of like uniting factor and i the brain 210 the dolphins 211 the heart 212 and the alien 209 seem like very random

give them to me or should i like play with them and then tell you and then how will i know when to move on will you just take them away thats a lot of things i dont think sook so my first observation is that theyre 201204 all round and or like spherically inspired if you will this 202 is probably the most standard sphere out of all of them this 201 ones fun because it has spikes on it so you know more surface area not quite a lot of conicals on the spheres on the sphere this 204 is like slightly more squarish because its got like a i guess cylindrical is the better word because its got flat on top and bottom and this 203 one reminds me of a virus i actually really didnt like these 203 ones as a kid but they have a lot of suction cups all around colorwise this 202 is the most standard its got pink and its got black lettering on it it says high bounce pinky and it was made in china this 201 one is actually i lied this 201 is the most standard coloring cause its just blue but it is clear um and i would say this 202 is second because it has two colors in it and then this 203 is three or four if you count the its 203 green blue red and then it has a very clear center holding all those suctions together and this 204 one is one two three four colors green red black and yellow this 204 one has a very like pardon me if this is not accurate description but like almost like native or like tribal design it is not like western design if that makes sense it 204 also is made out of fabric um like i dont know what this would be if it was like knitted or im not quite familiar with fabric terms this 202 one is like matte looking but its very soft and smooth like i dont know how to describe this texture i think thats the best i can do i know theres a word for it but its not coming to mind this 201 is like siliconey like a little bit of a grip and its like sticky not sticky as in it like it sticks to me but like when i am touching it 201 is it has a stronger adherance my fingers and then this 203 is a suction one but it doesnt seem to be suctioning very well this 204 ones just relatively soft i think i can do more do you want me to do moreok how is it too specific to like talk about the specific details of whats on it video glitches for a few seconds oh yeah thats one thing is that they 201204 all look like toys why dont i mention that this 202 is a bouncy ball as said by high bounce i dont actually know what this 201 is like for but it 201 is certainly like a children or dog toy i know this is a toy oh there we go so it 203 like suctions to the table and stuff like that i know you can throw it 203 this 204 looks like a hacky sack i guess because theres no other indication of what this could be used for id probably see it 204 as a hacky sack what other things i think that that is the majority of my thoughtsawesome should i make any distinctions between the next group and that group or is it just within the group ok these 205208 are also all toys these 205 206 two are very similar in both color and material these 207 208 two are not this 207 similarly theyre 205208 all spherically inspired though this 205 is definitely a little bit more complicated this 205 reminds me of like a jack if thats what theyre called the metal spokes these 205 206 two are made of that like silicony tacky material and are very like neon colored or at least i would describe this 205 206 as highlighter colored this 208 one is more soft and squishy it 208 reminds me of those i dont know there was a trend recently where there was like where people had like object and food shaped squishing things like this oh stress balls like that kind of material um and its 208 got its like a dodgeball when you squeeze it like air comes out this 207 one is made of a lot of little strings each of the strings is very is matte and also kind of like a silicon texture audio cuts out again siliconish 207 i would say this 207 is the least complex color wise this 207 is green and yellow these 205 206 guys are blue green yellow orange pink and purple orange yellow pink and purple 205 206 and theres no center to them 205 206 unlike that suction ball 203 its 205 206 hollow on the inside and but they are all like looped together so theyre all interacting within each other and this 205 one has little balls at the tips of each of the points and it looks like theyre stars actually im just realizing that that each of the little colors are stars this 208 is a globe and its got all the countries on it that im aware of theres an indentation here 208 so it like sits flat which im not sure if that was intentional but its like so well indented that it seems like it was intentional so it wouldnt roll off thats another thing is that none of these 205208 really roll consistently i think the pink one 202 would roll the best because it 202 is a true sphere but yeah trying to think i guess they oh all of these 205208 have like give none of them are like rock hard or like thick or solid um this 207 one is the most malleable shapewise because its kind of like liquid in which it like fills up whatever the space is you can press it 207 together you could probably also tie things together that is my guess of that is i think all that comes to mind immediately awesome oh my gosh i love these 211 guys ok i want to say these 209212 are all toys but i wouldnt really classify this 212 as a toy i also dont think i would classify this 210 as a toy because this seems to me like more adult oriented stress reliever this 210 and the globe 208 are slightly different material but to me like the same effect and the same general purpose this 210 has less air when you squeeze it this 208 is easier to squeeze this 210 has more resistance so im guessing this 210 is like a thicker foam or whatnot this 210 also looks like some kind of merchandise for druthers title company which im guessing is some i dont know if its 210 a brain im wondering what its related to i dont think thats relevant this 209 is a little alien or cartoon alien he 209 it looks like his arms are bendy can i bend him 209ok yeah yeah its one of those guys where when you move the body it stays in that position so you can make him 209 do a lot of different things im going to make him 209 sit down these 209212 are all reminding me of things that you would win as like a kid at like a little toy like a little fair maybe for your school or if for example like you had assigned readings or like whoever read the most books wins a prize from the prize box these 209212 would all be things in the prize box this 212 is like a bead or like a large bead because theres a hole through it for the stringing of anything its 212 heartshaped and it 212 is red 212 looks kind of like a stone crystal kind of thing though im guessing its pretty cheap on the inside it 212 honestly looks like there is glitter glue in it but its not like a perfectly clear red it has like striations and its you can see that theres like an inner like the tubing of where the hollow is gone through this 211 i dont remember what you call these 211 but i love playing with these 211 the one thing and that is demonstrated here is that theyre 211 very sticky so lint and everything stick to it um they are it 211 has dolphins in it two three dolphins 211 and again i dont know what this 211 is called but i know theyre 211 fun because you can hardly like hold them right and they always like kind of flop around you can probably stick something through it 211 but its probably going to be really tough because of all the give or the stickiness inside it 211 has a little bit of glitter inside which i know this 212 isnt like intentionally glittered i dont think but they 211 212 both have theyre 211 212 both sparkly this 211 is blue this 209 is green and black um this 210 is purple and white and this 212 is generally red um this 212 is like a glass material i dont and this 211 is probably just filled with some kind of liquid um which im not quite sure what that would be this 209 i i dont really know what material this 209 is but it is something that is malleable and this 210 i think is like foam with the color coating or like some coating of some kind yesso these 213216 all clearly have a very theyre 213216 all in the same category of little coin purses can i open them or are they rubber banded for a reason ok so the biggest difference is the patterns on all of them 213216 it seems like theyre all made from a similar manufacturer because the metal on all of them 213216 are pretty much identical theyre 213216 obviously like asian inspired designs and like kind of like the silky material though im sure its not real silk these 215 216 two are different they have like i dont know what it is but shiny threading has like a different like a rougher texture to it than like plain color threading so kind of like an itchy if you go against the grain its a little bit scratchy these 213 214 two are both butterflied plain background with butterfly embroidery this 213 is like a i will call this something like a really bright magenta like red slight like reddish pink um and then the butterflies are light pink and white and kind of bronzy looking theyre pretty ornate this 214 one is also light pink white and bronzy looking but there are different butterflies yeah theyre 213 214 pretty different um they 213214 have different patterns and different the way that their heads are embroidered looks a little different ok and then this216 guy is yellow and gold based with so its like yellowishy kind of muted green yellow and its got white embroidering with gold threading embroidering like i was talking about this 215 ones a blue like a royal blue background with that kind of it has like a shiny like i think its silver threading and then like a greenish yellow chartreuse and kind of like again like wine like a red purple color yeah this 215 looks like theres a chrysanthemum on it but otherwise theres a lot of like mandalas and like leaves very floral imagery theres a straight up just five petaled flower there um very ornate and this 216 one im trying to see if this is the same design it 216 looks it looks like it is the same design 215 i think it is the same obviously different colors they 213216 are different in filling trying to see if i can order them in how full i think they are these 214 215 two are certainly less full and these 213 216 two are certainly more i believe this 213 is the most full and its like i think its my my guess is circular beads but i dont really feel them that well yeah theyre theyre spherical beads in here 213 this 216 feels less like beads and more like a sandish kind of texture like some some grain sand kind of thing this 214 feels kind of like a hybrid like maybe just smaller beads but it doesnt feel as fine as that 216 thats 215 crunchy this 215 also feels like circular beads maybe slightly bigger i think because this has i think this 215 is less full but they are beads so they feel bigger this left to right 213 216 214 215 would be my ranking of most 213 to least 215 full but these 214 215 could be kinda switched around and id be ok with it either way and theyre 213216 all rubber banded shut i dont know if the rubber band is part of the description ok they 213216 just seem like pretty standard rubber bands to hold things closed theyre slightly different in color this ones 213 more yellow this ones 214 more pinkish but thats probably just wear and tear or miscoloring oh this 214 has purple on it i was looking just at this side 214 but it actually has different butterflies in the back this is yellow and purple these 213 seem oh this 213 one also has blue ok so theyre slightly different on each side which im guessing is just like the pattern didnt fully complete but i do i am pretty confident that these 215 216 are very that these are the same pattern with different colors yeahawesome ok we have generally moved from a theme of like kiddish toys to what i would now classify like as my asian grandmothers things got the coin purses 213216 and weve got these 217220 fabrics which are certainly less child oriented this 217 is very felty this 217 reminds me of what you would make like a puppet out of or like a christmas stocking the like when you have like the name on the stocking this is the material that name would be made out of if it wasnt just directly printed on this 219 is like i dont know my fabrics very well i dont know what linen feels like this 219 is what i would guess linen feels like even though i think linens a little rougher like is it 219 polyester not quite sure but it 219 has a different texture at the bottom strip um and it 219 has holes in like a like a zigzag pattern which im guessing is just stitching that was removed this 220 one is lace this 218 is is this linen i think these 218 219 are different textures this 218 seems a little this 219 seems softer but this 218 doesnt necessarily seem less smooth all of the endings 217220 have been cut and i think this 218 is the most like frayed ending this 218 also looks like it could have been like a thread was pulled because you got that like the holes like the threading looks like theres gaps um this part 218 looks like it was cut generally but just not like cleanly because theres a lot of the stray fibers i feel like lace 220 in general is easier to cut without it being all everywhere its 220 got a hair in it which is not great um this 219 one is similar to the dark maroonish one 218 also 219 has hairs in it that 219 also is frayed at the ends and this felty one 217 also has a lot actually i think thats just fuzz right ok thats just a lot of fuzz 217 but this 217 seems like it was cut and i think this 217 is easily more easily cut out of all of them has the least like variation of how its cut in terms of like inconsistent edges all right these 217 218 two are plain colors this 217 is a very standard red to me maybe like slightly orangey this 218 is a maroonish to me maybe slightly purpley for maroon they 217220 all kind of attract a little bit of lint which is i think what fabrics just do so say these 217 218 two are similar in that they are solid colorings these 219 220 are both like white based this 219 has a goldish little design which i would describe honestly as like almost like little incomplete rabbits theres 219 a lot of like this shape gestures a loop shape in the air which reminds me of like rabbit ears but theyre not theyre just lines frankly there are no closed shapes that i see theres 219 squiggles looks kind of like a mountain range or like curly hairs and then this 219 ending has like a green stitching in it to hold it together im not quite sure why this 219 has this ending like maybe it was part of like not like a curtain but like some sort of something it was attached to something is why my guess would be of this like white strip at the end with the green stitching i dont really like lace 220 and i never really have i think the texture has always bothered me especially when i was younger this 220 one is different from the front and the back the front is definitely more sparkly it has like a ribboned threading its like the threadings not straight its like gestures a curved shape and it 220 has that same like lace i think sparkly lace has sort of that like itchy feel as well and then the base of lace i really dislike its 220 like almost like honeycombish like honeycombesque like scaly and holeish but these 220 are flowers with leaves and a trimming or scalloped trimming at the end these 219 are these mysterious lines different on the front and the back the back 219 is just seems like it is intended to be the back because the pattern is more faint this 218 doesnt seem to have a front or a back to me this 218 just is and this 217 just is as welloh awesomesherpa 222 oh no its 222 like fleece well ok so four 221224 more fabrics um clearly this is very similar to the last pile in that theyre 221224 all rectangular fabric cuts ok this 222 is one of my favorite materials of all time i dont know what it is so after this im going to ask you what material this 222 is my least favorite thing about this 222 material is that it attracts a lot of lints and lots of fuzz and hair this 222 looks like sherpa but what i know are my sherpa coats are not this soft um so this is i think what my baby blanket is made out of its 222 very soft i adore this material its 222 very fluffy on one side and a lot smoother on the back and its got like that stitching on the side so its a little bit of a rougher kind of feel if this 222 was cut i dont think it was cut here it was cut on probably the sides if it was cut it 222 is so soft i really enjoy this 222 its like a sheep though im sure sheep are rougher 222 i think wool is just like a rougher itchier texture i dont know what this 222 is called honestly fleece or sherpa or something like that this 224 is like burlap bag um but black i kind of would associate this 223 texture with brown um its 224 very gridded um lot of hatching its clear that well i wanna say its clear that it 224 wasnt cut on these sides because theres like a very like it looks like an intentional fray because theres not the horizontals but now that im looking at it i might be lying it may it may be cut on these ends im not quite sure this ending 224 actually may not be cut because it has like a reinforced like a much thicker braiding over here or weaving i guess is better each of the lines 224 is a lot thicker so im guessing theres just more fabric per line this 224 is like its almost like hair looking because its so frizzed none of the lines are like really clean theyre all kind of like frayed and hairy and its 224 a rough like doesnt feel great to me at least yeah its 224 black ok this 221 i think is like velvet there was a trend for a while of velvet clothing and i hated that trend because i do not like velvet fabric very much i think velvet in general is like fun because you can when you pull it the opposite to the grain theres a like a like a furry resistance but then when you pull with the grain its very smooth um i dont really like velvet 221 because of the way that velvet always looks splotched i think this is generally just caused by the different elevation of like fuzziness because these are a lot denser patches it looks like and theyre a lot softer and thicker whereas these are more like smooth kind of flattened the opposite side 221  grosses me out honestly its like a black way to hold the whole fabric together this 221 again i would say is not cut because this is looks like a intentionally different edging it 221 was probably cut this way because it leans and this also is definitely cut because you can see like the scissor like incisions as well as here i would describe this 221 as red like a deep scarlet oh i will say but the way that velvet 221 is like the light reflection at an angle itll look like a different color so it looks a lot darker from this angle now but like this it looks a lot lighter this 223 is like i also dont like this texture very much of like this kind of clothing it 223 feels like a like a soft dog which i like soft dogs but theres something about seeing them on a flat square that makes me feel uneasy the back 223 is a lot rougher kind of that itchy material i would not wear a shirt made of this material i would not like it very much the front 223 is very like fur hair it 223 definitely isnt hair like real hair but it also isnt like mimicking hair its a little too soft i think to be mimicking hair its 223 definitely fur and when i say hair i mean human hair straight relatively straight hair 223 um i think it was cut on these edges this seems to have like a glue on the bottom so im wondering if the manufacturer of this just glued the fur on because this looks like a glue um its also got those holes so it looks like a thread was pulled out overall if i were to say like a way that these 221224 all generally differ from that group 217220 i dont know if id have like a general difference they 221224 are just different materials theyre all 217224 different materials so youve got like the lace 220 and the i dont know what this 217 is called oh felt the lace 220 and the felt 217 like the linenish polyesterish 218 219 then weve got like the fur texture 223 and then velvet 221 and then burlap 224 i dont actually know what oh it 224 fell apart i dont know what the actual name for this 224 fabric is but this is what i associate with brown potato bags and then this fleece slash sherpa 222 that im not sure what it is this 222 is like an off ivory cream white this 224 is like a matte black or really really dark gray this 223 is like a shiny furry black yeah and this 221 is like i said before a deep red depending on the way the light hits it i think that is my general description of these 221224 four i think the clearest thing to me is just the very distinct grouping of these 201212 as separate from these 213224 just because these 201212 all seem like generally child oriented again i think these 202 210 are less child oriented these 202 210 seem more like youd find this like a goodie bag of like a selfcare kit this 210 is like something uchicago would totally give out in terms of like a stress ball and then i mean maybe because this 202 is a bouncy ball its 202 more kid oriented because i dont really think bouncy balls are typically seen as like for adults whereas stress squeezers are more so adultoriented now but like this 201 203 205 206 207 209 category is certainly toys this 204 seems a little less kid appealing because of the muted more like earthy colors and like the much brighter colors are what im gonna associate more with children this 212 just seems like a very cheap bead but its really big and its pretty gaudy so i think if an adult were wearing this bead depends on what for i think it could be like a crafty accessory would be kind of cool but if it were intended to be like like a fancy wellmade jewelry i would not think that would be working so i would also associate that 212 with like maybe like lower like older children young tweens is tweens a wordum and i i associate these 213216 with like older women like grandmothers for sure i associate these 221224 fabrics with like a theater department like swatches for costume design but yeah definitely distinguish these 201212 213216 217224 three separate groups maybe these 213216 217224 are the same group because theyre more like feminine adult oriented but i think id prefer them distinctly like this 201212 213216 217224 theyre these 213216 217224 are not as clearly together as much as these 213216 are all the same object um theres a lot of different textures a lot of soft a lot of rough and itchy a lot of like siliconey sticky 206 same with here 211 i like to hold this 211 one i think its very fun i do not think i have that many other observations to make', 'sentence-tokens': ['Should I be looking there or at youok So should I start describing as soon as you give them to me or should I like play with them and then tell you and then how will I know when to move on?', 'Will you just take them away?', 'Thats a lot of things, I dont think sook.', 'So my first observation is that theyre 201204 all round and or like spherically inspired if you will.', 'This 202 is probably the most standard sphere out of all of them.', 'This 201 ones fun because it has spikes on it so you know more surface area.', 'Not quite a lot of conicals on the spheres on the sphere.', 'This 204 is like slightly more squarish because its got like a I guess cylindrical is the better word because its got flat on top and bottom and this 203 one reminds me of a virus.', 'I actually really didnt like these 203 ones as a kid, but they have a lot of suction cups all around.', 'Colorwise, this 202 is the most standard.', 'Its got pink and its got black lettering on it.', 'It says high bounce pinky and it was made in China This 201 one is actually I lied this 201 is the most standard coloring cause its just blue.', 'but it is clear.', 'Um, and I would say this 202 is second because it has two colors in it and then this 203 is three or four if you count the its 203 green, blue, red and then it has a very clear center holding all those suctions together.', 'And this 204 one is one, two, three, four colors, green, red, black and yellow.', 'This 204 one has a very like pardon me if this is not accurate description but like almost like native or like tribal design.', 'It is not like western design if that makes sense.', 'It 204 also is made out of fabric.', 'Um like I dont know what this would be if it was like knitted or Im not quite familiar with fabric terms.', 'This 202 one is like matte looking but its very soft and smooth.', 'Like I dont know how to describe this texture.', 'I think thats the best I can do.', 'I know theres a word for it but its not coming to mind.', 'This 201 is like siliconey like a little bit of a grip and its like sticky, not sticky as in it like it sticks to me but like when I am touching it 201 is it has a stronger adherance my fingers and then this 203 is a suction one but it doesnt seem to be suctioning very well.', 'This 204 ones just relatively soft.', 'I think I can do more.', 'Do you want me to do moreok How is it too specific to like?', 'Talk about the specific details of whats on it.', 'Video glitches for a few seconds.', 'Oh yeah, Thats one thing is that they 201204 all look like toys.', 'Why dont I mention that this 202 is a bouncy ball?', 'As said by high bounce, I dont actually know what this 201 is like for, but it 201 is certainly like a children or dog toy.', 'I know this is a toy.', 'Oh, there we go.', 'So it 203 Like suctions to the table and stuff like that, I know you can throw it 203.', 'This 204 looks like a hacky sack.', 'I guess because theres no other indication of what this could be used for, Id probably see it 204 as a hacky sack.', 'What other things?', 'I think that that is the majority of my thoughtsawesome.', 'Should I make any distinctions between the next group and that group?', 'Or is it just within the group?', 'Ok, these 205208 are also all toys.', 'These 205 206 two are very similar in both color and material.', 'These 207 208 two are not this 207.', 'Similarly, theyre 205208.', 'All spherically inspired.', 'Though this 205 is definitely a little bit more complicated, This 205 reminds me of like a jack if thats what theyre called.', 'The metal spokes.', 'These 205 206 two are made of that like silicony tacky material and are very like neon colored.', 'Or at least I would describe this 205 206 as highlighter colored.', 'This 208 one is more soft and squishy.', 'It 208 reminds me of those.', 'I dont know.', 'There was a trend recently where there was like where people had like object and food shaped squishing things like this.', 'Oh stress balls like that kind of material.', 'Um, and its 208.', 'Got its like a dodgeball when you squeeze it like air comes out.', 'This 207 one is made of a lot of little strings.', 'Each of the strings is very is matte and also kind of like a silicon texture.', 'Audio cuts out again.', 'siliconish.', '207.', 'I would say this 207 is the least complex.', 'Color wise, this 207 is green and yellow.', 'These 205 206 guys are blue, green, yellow, orange, pink and purple, orange, yellow, pink and purple.', '205 206 and theres no center to them.', '205 206 Unlike that suction ball 203, its 205 206 Hollow on the inside and but they are all like looped together so theyre all interacting within each other.', 'And this 205 one has little balls at the tips of each of the points and it looks like theyre stars.', 'Actually, Im just realizing that that each of the little colors are stars.', 'This 208 is a globe and its got all the countries on it that Im aware of.', 'Theres an indentation here 208 so it like sits flat, which Im not sure if that was intentional, but its like so well indented that it seems like it was intentional so it wouldnt roll off.', 'Thats another thing is that none of these 205208 really roll consistently.', 'I think the pink one 202 would roll the best because it 202 is a true sphere.', 'But yeah, trying to think.', 'I guess they oh all of these 205208 have like give.', 'None of them are like rock hard or like thick or solid.', 'Um, this 207 one is the most malleable shapewise because its kind of like liquid in which it like fills up.', 'Whatever the space is, you can press it 207 together.', 'You could probably also tie things together.', 'That is my guess of that is I think all that comes to mind immediately.', 'Awesome.', 'Oh my gosh, I love these 211 guys.', 'Ok, I want to say these 209212 are all toys, but I wouldnt really classify this 212 as a toy.', 'I also dont think I would classify this 210 as a toy because this seems to me like more adult oriented stress reliever.', 'This 210 and the globe 208 are slightly different material, but to me like the same effect and the same general purpose.', 'This 210 has less air when you squeeze it.', 'This 208 is easier to squeeze.', 'This 210 has more resistance so Im guessing this 210 is like a thicker foam or whatnot.', 'This 210 also looks like some kind of merchandise for Druthers Title Company, which Im guessing is some.', 'I dont know if its 210 a brain.', 'Im wondering what its related to.', 'I dont think thats relevant.', 'This 209 is a little alien or cartoon alien.', 'He 209.', 'It looks like his arms are bendy.', 'Can I bend him?', '209ok?', 'Yeah.', 'yeah.', 'Its one of those guys where when you move the body, it stays in that position so you can make him 209 do a lot of different things.', 'Im going to make him 209 sit down.', 'These 209212 are all reminding me of things that you would win as like a kid at like a little toy, like a little fair.', 'maybe for your school or if for example, like you had assigned readings or like whoever read the most books wins a prize from the prize box.', 'These 209212 would all be things in the prize box.', 'This 212 is like a bead or like a large bead because theres a hole through it for the stringing of anything.', 'Its 212 heartshaped and it 212 is red.', '212 looks kind of like a stone crystal kind of thing though Im guessing its pretty cheap on the inside.', 'It 212 honestly looks like there is glitter glue in it, but its not like a perfectly clear red.', 'It has like striations and its you can see that theres like an inner like the tubing of where the hollow is gone through this 211.', 'I dont remember what you call these 211 but I love playing with these 211.', 'The one thing and that is demonstrated here is that theyre 211.', 'Very sticky, so lint and everything.', 'stick to it.', 'Um they are.', 'It 211 has dolphins in it.', 'Two three dolphins 211 and again I dont know what this 211 is called but I know theyre 211 fun because you can hardly like hold them right and they always like kind of flop around.', 'You can probably stick something through it 211 but its probably going to be really tough because of all the give or the stickiness inside it.', '211 has a little bit of glitter inside, which I know this 212 isnt like intentionally glittered.', 'I dont think.', 'but they 211 212 both have.', 'Theyre 211, 212.', 'Both sparkly.', 'This 211 is blue, This 209 is green and black.', 'Um, this 210 is purple and white, and this 212 is generally red.', 'Um, this 212 is like a glass material.', 'I dont and this 211 is probably just filled with some kind of liquid.', 'um, which Im not quite sure what that would be.', 'This 209.', 'I I dont really know what material this 209 is, but it is something that is malleable.', 'and this 210 I think is like foam with the color coating or like some coating of some kind.', 'Yesso these 213216 all clearly have a very theyre 213216. all in the same category of little coin purses.', 'Can I open them or are they rubber banded for a reason?', 'Ok, so the biggest difference is the patterns on all of them 213216 It seems like theyre all made from a similar manufacturer because the metal on all of them 213216 are pretty much identical.', 'Theyre 213216, obviously like Asian inspired designs and like kind of like the silky material though Im sure its not real silk.', 'These 215 216 two are different.', 'They have like I dont know what it is but shiny threading has like a different like a rougher texture to it than like plain color threading.', 'so kind of like an itchy if you go against the grain its a little bit scratchy.', 'These 213 214 two are both butterflied plain background with butterfly embroidery.', 'This 213 is like a I will call this something like a really bright magenta like red, slight like reddish pink um and then the butterflies are light pink and white and kind of bronzy looking.', 'Theyre pretty ornate.', 'This 214 one is also light pink, white and bronzy looking.', 'But there are different butterflies.', 'Yeah theyre 213 214 pretty different.', 'Um they 213214 have different patterns and different.', 'The way that their heads are embroidered looks a little different.', 'Ok and then this216 guy is yellow and gold based with so its like yellowishy kind of muted green yellow and its got white embroidering with gold threading.', 'embroidering like I was talking about this.', '215 ones a blue like a royal blue background with that kind of it has like a shiny like i think its silver threading and then like a greenish yellow chartreuse and kind of like again like wine like a red purple color.', 'Yeah this 215 looks like theres a chrysanthemum on it but otherwise theres a lot of like mandalas and like leaves.', 'very floral imagery.', 'Theres a straight up just five petaled flower there um very ornate and this 216 one Im trying to see if this is the same design.', 'it 216 looks it looks like it is the same design 215.', 'I think it is the same.', 'obviously different colors.', 'They 213216 are different in filling.', 'Trying to see if I can order them in how full I think they are.', 'These 214 215 two are certainly less full and these 213 216 two are certainly more.', 'I believe this 213 is the most full and its like I think its my my guess is circular beads, but I dont really feel them that well.', 'yeah, theyre theyre spherical beads in here 213.', 'This 216 feels less like beads and more like a sandish kind of texture.', 'like some some grain sand kind of thing.', 'This 214 feels kind of like a hybrid.', 'Like maybe just smaller beads, but it doesnt feel as fine as that 216.', 'Thats 215 crunchy.', 'This 215 also feels like circular beads.', 'maybe slightly bigger I think because this has.', 'I think this 215 is less full, but they are beads so they feel bigger.',

rubber banded shut.', 'I dont know if the rubber band is part of the description.', 'Ok, they 213216 just seem like pretty standard rubber bands to hold things closed.', 'Theyre slightly different in color.', 'this ones 213 more yellow, this ones 214 more pinkish, but thats probably just wear and tear or miscoloring.', 'Oh, this 214 has purple on it.', 'I was looking just at this side 214 but it actually has different butterflies in the back.', 'This is yellow and purple these 213 seem.', 'Oh, this 213 one also has blue.', 'Ok, so theyre slightly different on each side, which Im guessing is just like the pattern didnt fully complete.', 'But I do.', 'I am pretty confident that these 215 216 are very that These are the same pattern with different colors.', 'Yeahawesome.', 'Ok, we have generally moved from a theme of like Kiddish Toys to what I would now classify like as my Asian grandmothers things.', 'Got the coin purses 213216 and weve got these 217220 fabrics which are certainly less child oriented.', 'This 217 is very felty.', 'This 217 reminds me of what you would make like a puppet out of or like a Christmas stocking.', 'the like when you have like the name on the stocking.', 'This is the material that name would be made out of if it wasnt just directly printed on.', 'This 219 is like I dont know my fabrics very well.', 'I dont know what linen feels like.',

different textures.', 'This 218 seems a little.', 'This 219 seems softer, but this 218 doesnt necessarily seem less smooth.', 'All of the endings 217220 have been cut and I think this 218 is the most like frayed ending.', 'This 218 also looks like it could have been like a thread was pulled because you got that.', 'Like the holes, like the threading looks like theres gaps.', 'Um, this part 218 looks like it was cut generally, but just not like cleanly because theres a lot of the stray fibers.', 'I feel like Lace 220 in general is easier to cut without it being all everywhere.', 'Its 220 got a hair in it which is not great.', 'Um, this 219 one is similar to the dark maroonish One 218.', 'Also, 219 has hairs in it.', 'That 219 also is frayed at the ends and this felty One 217 also has a lot.', 'Actually, I think thats just fuzz, right?', 'Ok, thats just a lot of Fuzz 217, But this 217 seems like it was cut and I think this 217 is easily more easily cut out of all of them has the least like variation of how its cut in terms of like inconsistent edges.', 'All right, These 217 218 two are plain colors.', 'This 217 is a very standard red to me, maybe like slightly orangey.', 'This 218 is a maroonish to me, maybe slightly purpley.', 'For maroon, they 217220 all kind of attract a little bit of lint, which is I think what fabrics just do.', 'So say these 217 218 two are similar in that they are solid colorings.', 'These 219 220 are both like white based.', 'This 219 has a goldish little design which I would describe honestly as like almost like little incomplete rabbits.', 'Theres 219 A lot of like.', 'This shape gestures a loop shape in the air which reminds me of like rabbit ears, but theyre not, theyre just lines.', 'Frankly, there are no closed shapes that I see.', 'Theres 219 squiggles, looks kind of like a mountain range or like curly hairs.', 'And then this 219 ending has like a green stitching in it to hold it together.', 'Im not quite sure why this 219 has this ending, like maybe it was part of like not like a curtain, but like some sort of something it was attached to.', 'Something is why my guess would be of this like white strip at the end with the green stitching.', 'I dont really like lace 220 and I never really have.', 'I think the texture has always bothered me, especially when I was younger.', 'This 220 one is different from the front and the back.', 'The front is definitely more sparkly.', 'It has like a ribboned threading.', 'Its like the threadings, not straight.', 'Its like gestures a curved shape.', 'And it 220 has that same like lace.', 'I think sparkly lace has sort of that like itchy feel as well.', 'and then the base of lace.', 'I really dislike its 220.', 'Like, almost like honeycombish.', 'Like honeycombesque, like scaly and holeish.', 'But these 220 are flowers with leaves and a trimming or scalloped trimming at the end.', 'These 219 are these mysterious lines different on the front and the back.', 'The back 219 is just seems like it is intended to be the back because the pattern is more faint.', 'This 218 doesnt seem to have a front or a back.', 'To me, this 218 just is.', 'and this 217 just is as welloh awesomesherpa 222.', 'Oh no, its 222.', 'Like fleece.', 'Well, Ok so Four 221224, more fabrics.', 'Um, clearly this is very similar to the last pile in that theyre 221224.', 'All rectangular fabric cuts.', 'Ok, this 222 is one of my favorite materials of all time.', 'I dont know what it is, so after this Im going to ask you what material this 222 is.', 'My least favorite thing about this 222 material is that it attracts a lot of lints and lots of fuzz and hair.', 'This 222 looks like sherpa.', 'but what I know are my sherpa coats are not this soft.', 'Um, so this is.', 'I think what my baby blanket is made out of Its 222.', 'Very soft.', 'I adore this material.', 'Its 222.', 'Very fluffy on one side and a lot smoother on the back.', 'And its got like that stitching on the side so its a little bit of a rougher kind of feel.', 'If this 222 was cut, I dont think it was cut here.', 'It was cut on probably the sides.', 'If it was cut, it 222 is so soft.', 'I really enjoy this 222.', 'Its like a sheep though.', 'Im sure sheep are rougher 222 I think.', 'Wool is just like a rougher itchier texture.', 'I dont know what this 222 is called honestly.', 'fleece or sherpa or something like that.', 'This 224 is like burlap bag.', 'um but black.', 'I kind of would associate this 223 texture with brown.', 'Um, its 224.', 'Very gridded, um lot of hatching.', 'Its clear that well I wanna say its clear that it 224 wasnt cut on these sides because theres like a very like it looks like an intentional fray because theres not the horizontals.', 'But now that Im looking at it I might be lying.', 'It may it may be cut on these ends.', 'Im not quite sure this ending 224 actually may not be cut because it has like a reinforced like a much thicker braiding over here or weaving I guess is better.', 'Each of the lines 224 is a lot thicker so Im guessing theres just more fabric per line.', 'This 224 is like its almost like hair looking because its so frizzed.', 'None of the lines are like really clean.', 'theyre all kind of like frayed and hairy.', 'and its 224.', 'A rough like doesnt feel great to me at least.', 'Yeah its 224 black.', 'Ok this 221 I think is like velvet.', 'There was a trend for a while of velvet clothing and I hated that trend because I do not like velvet fabric very much.', 'I think velvet in general is like fun because you can when you pull it the opposite to the grain.', 'theres a like a like a furry resistance but then when you pull with the grain its very smooth.', 'Um I dont really like velvet 221 because of the way that velvet always looks splotched.', 'I think this is generally just caused by the different elevation of like fuzziness because these are a lot denser patches it looks like and theyre a lot softer and thicker whereas these are more like smooth kind of flattened.', 'The opposite side 221 grosses me out honestly its like a black way to hold the whole fabric together.', 'This 221 again I would say is not cut because this is looks like a intentionally different edging It 221 was probably cut this way because it leans and this also is definitely cut because you can see like the scissor like incisions as well as here.', 'I would describe this 221 as red like a deep scarlet.', 'Oh I will say but the way that Velvet 221 is like the light reflection at an angle, Itll look like a different color so it looks a lot darker from this angle now.', 'but like this it looks a lot lighter this 223 is like.', 'I also dont like this texture very much of like this kind of clothing.', 'It 223 feels like a like a soft dog, which I like soft dogs, but theres something about seeing them on a flat square that makes me feel uneasy.', 'The back 223 is a lot rougher, kind of that itchy material.', 'I would not wear a shirt made of this material.', 'I would not like it very much.', 'The front 223 is very like fur hair.', 'It 223 definitely isnt hair like real hair.', 'but it also isnt like mimicking hair.', 'Its a little too soft.', 'I think to be mimicking hair, Its 223.', 'Definitely fur.', 'And when I say hair, I mean human hair.', 'Straight, relatively straight hair.', '223.', 'Um, I think it was cut on these edges.', 'This seems to have like a glue on the bottom.', 'So Im wondering if the manufacturer of this just glued the fur on because this looks like a glue.', 'Um, its also got those holes so it looks like a thread was pulled out.', 'Overall, if I were to say like a way that these 221224 all generally differ from that group 217220, I dont know if Id have like a general difference.', 'They 221224 are just different materials.', 'Theyre all 217224 different materials.', 'So youve got like the Lace 220 and the I dont know what this 217 is called.', 'Oh, felt the Lace 220 and the Felt 217 like the linenish polyesterish 218 219.', 'Then weve got like the Fur Texture 223 and then Velvet 221 and then Burlap 224.', 'I dont actually know what.', 'Oh, it 224 fell apart.', 'I dont know what the actual name for this 224 fabric is, but this is what I associate with brown potato bags and then this fleece slash sherpa 222 that Im not sure what it is.', 'This 222 is like an off ivory cream white.', 'This 224 is like a matte black or really really dark gray.', 'This 223 is like a shiny furry black.', 'Yeah, and this 221 is like I said before, a deep red depending on the way the light hits it.', 'I think that is my general description of these 221224 four.', 'I think the clearest thing to me is just the very distinct grouping of these 201212 as separate from these 213224.', 'Just because these 201212 all seem like generally child oriented.', 'Again, I think these 202 210 are less child oriented.', 'These 202 210 seem more like youd find this like a goodie bag of like a selfcare kit.', 'This 210 is like something Uchicago would totally give out in terms of like a stress ball.', 'And then I mean maybe because this 202 is a bouncy ball, Its 202 more kid oriented because I dont really think bouncy balls are typically seen as like for adults, whereas stress squeezers are more so adultoriented now.', 'But like this, 201, 203, 205, 206, 207 209 category is certainly toys.', 'This 204 seems a little less kid appealing because of the muted, more like earthy colors.', 'and like the much brighter colors are what Im gonna associate more with children.', 'This 212 just seems like a very cheap bead.', 'but its really big and its pretty gaudy.', 'So I think if an adult were wearing this bead depends on what for.', 'I think it could be like a crafty accessory would be kind of cool, but if it were intended to be like like a fancy wellmade jewelry, I would not think that would be working.', 'So I would also associate that 212 with like, maybe like lower like older children.', 'Young Tweens is Tweens a wordum.', 'and I I associate these 213216 with like older Women like grandmothers for sure.', 'I associate these 221224 fabrics with like a

like a test im ready to failexactly ill give you a win ok its recording you readysicklovely incredible so right off the batthese babes are all round theyre spherical this one is more regular than the other ones the other ones have irregularities on the surface this one has small holes on account of it being made of yarn on the outside and the shape is also irregular not perfectly spherical because it is stuffed with something uh that does not maintain constant constant pressure on the outside unlike this which is filled with air um this also has an irregular surface more so because um there are things sticking out of it theyre all equidistant from the center but um they are small enough that it doesnt create a homogenous surface uh and this one has spikes on the outside so while it is like spherical um in its internal structure the spikes on the outside make it so that there isnt like a uniform surface um and then color also differs this one is pink with writing this is blue this is tricolored red blue and green and this is uh four colors green red black and yellow um and then the um where they interact with other things to produce like this is bouncy whereas this seems like its intended to stick to things because this kind of looks like this ok this lights up and then is filled with not say it reminds me of like so the impact is absorbed less elastic than something like this if word to use physical mechanics that i did not learn in my mechanics im really assessed with the fact that the flights up um i think that will be it for you with these objects ok sweet excellent so ill move them over here and then these are like free game now so if you think of anything else about them you can talk about the nice so let me just make sure that im actually yes i am i cant remember if i turned it on or not ok prove interesting ok so these two are similar in that theyre made out of the same material and it looks like theyre composed of maybe six of the same with each other this looks like the rings are shaped like stars and this is more like flowers um and theyre both made of a rubbery sort of material and each one of the things is a different color pink orange yellow green blue and purple so flower 1000 more so both are like generally spherical like the other just looked at the theres creator with the starwood because the points on the star center base spherical shape and then we have a world which very well word it has the world and it looks generally accurate i think this is not what you need for your data uh you have to sit down here not sit down off oh and there is less than sahara but i dont think its labeled armenia is there wonderful yeah many colors on this one predominantly blue because the ocean is colored blue it was grow as we tend to think of water the countries though are not uniformly colored probably to distinguish between them on the small sphere this is also when put in this group of objects looks like it intends to be spherical but the filaments that its composed of are or wanna say flacid there you go there you go thats whats coming out not rigid is what ill confirm its not rigid so the spherical shape is compressible made out of green yellow and well it looks like most of the filaments are equal length which word generally imply that it will be defined by the same distance from the center naturally um it is its it doesnt really act like a sphere because of lack of rigidity in its structure and it does not this one does uh i think i like the colors on this im ready for my next 4 to the side this is incredible ok thank you for putting one of these in i this reminds me of my childhood i love these things so this is like a tube of plastic blue liquid glitter and plastic dolphins its compressible in the way that well look what are compressed oh well actually im unclear on that because my friend had a piece at that said that liquids are compressible so interesting i dont know enough about linguistic confirm nor did i but is the theres enough air which allows someone to to be compressed slightly without version squishy and it the composition of the of the object make it so that wow of it turns it on itself which is play with the next object is a heart it shaped like a heart it is red its slightly iridescent theres a hole in the center that may think it would be and that doesnt really bounce it also doesnt really bounce theres a bit of traction in the color that theyre like some lighter stripes and darker stripes on the surface it looks like its made of plastic um theres some tiny air bubbles trapped within the information its like a deeper red some more its more of a it is on the warmer side on the cooler side of the roads but umm ill come back to that i cant think of it right where is the red that it is her holes in his back which is so interesting in the joints where his joints would be very tiny little holes he has four fingers on each hand and well it looks like three toes and the head just like egg shaped the body is what we generally think of as like a human body with a torso and two legs and two arms although it is simplified due to the fact that it is tiny and made of plastic sure sure is the verdict green but not its super bright its a good unit but still vibrant and pounce is a little bit um because little oval shaped eyes theyre black we just not stand up me i last object is a purple brain that has its also seems like a stressful its compressible reminds me complete the story of the world that we looked at earlier theres a uniform color to it there is like a ridge where probably the two halves of the mold came together to shape it and so there isnt like there that is that there is with the rest of the surface um on the surface of the object to make it look more like a brain i dont know enough about the actual structure of the brain to say whether its accurate it looks like my conception of the brain are similar enough to it that my my brain will tell me its white writing on the top pro 5 asi 36730 um its not really actually more so than the other objects higher very fun to play with i think the dolphins are blue on the top and then white on the bottom i think thats it really no ok the next 4 i see oh i see why theyre arranged yeah i think different things inside of each of them and so i should not open move on account of the thing is pulling up say it out loud for your these are four different purses that look compositionally similar in that they all have similar shape fabric composing the body of the bag and then silver clasps to close them theyre all the sushi yeah this first bag the fabric is plaque and it has bronze silver and pink butterflies on it for months maybe actually some of them look like models and some of them look like butterflies interesting the larger body reminds me more but also i should know better because ive been working with butterflies but i dont know if i know well enough this it feels like there are grains of rice in this bag that is small and somewhat granular but still like roughly not culture but like all belong perhaps one could say if one were to to wager a guess and theyre all classed closed or held tightly closed with rubber bands important morphological distinction this also feels like grains of rice although more so than this one this one it is not at its maximum capacity one might say i want to just this one is fully than the last one and so it is compressable like this one but there is more like substance within the bag which allows it to like the compressed more but still makes it larger than this one because theres less one and the fabric on this is like a yellow and theres embroidery with whitish silver thread and ankles thread and it looks like sort of paisley pattern in some places and like leaves its like a friend it reminds me sort of like on this one not have race in it if i were to wager a guess for sure for sure feels like theyre like larger objects in here more spherical than the other ones they dont feel entirely spherical but that could be because theyre in a bag but if i were to wager a guess trying play some smaller than like i would normally think of like this is filled like a similar black bag and then the color on the outside is there the cloth is blue with hello gold does the same or similar pattern to the yellow bag and theres some natural patterning and and this feels like its filled with the same things as this but also more so similar to how these two are made of the same things this feels less compressible than this one probably because the objects themselves in the better larger and theres like less actually dont know um but it feels like its its filled more so its like theres less room for things to go press it sounds like sounds like theres a rattle to it that this one does not have this one does have a little bit i think because its not filled so much this phone is like bright pink and there are theres some broidery with like light pink darker pink and like a bronze the light pink might actually be more silvery and its a similar pattern to the first one that had black and looking at it different background and color fascinating i think sweet sweet beautiful youre doing great two more groups left bro yeah heres the next one so right off the bat these are all clothes different kinds of clothes this is like lace oh like there are between its like the front facing and then the back is more like plainly white there is like stretch to it in the sections that are imported part stretches too but the stretches much and is theres texture to the top of it because the part sticks out more you could feel the improvement this ones like a sort of similar color it feels more like cotton maybe or like not cotton esque with that theres like an edge to the fabric here that is like typically included with fabrics when its manufactured to like prevent frame when its transported its like and theres like a small green stitch on the edge and theyre like holes between like the actual pattern programmers and my brain stitch that like alternate like a triangle pattern the fabric itself is like a slightly pastel violet color patches of like darker purple or molly and then like later purple um but like the colors fade enough but like it could be considered neutral almost like an off white there are like not in order details but printed details and gold the organic another arent like hard rigid lines they remind me of motion like kind of reminds me like from far away currents or clouds and some places theres like a slight stretch to it but like the fabric is tight movement enough that there isnt like the same gapping but like the closer you pull because theres less fabric to stretch and this is similar to the last piece about the texture is similarly tightly woven this is a little bit softer and maybe a little bit thicker than this fabric this i would  ruby on the color you cant help me with this its almost maroon perhaps this is where we are considered there yeah the color of my shirts a bit darker more muted this is a bit more like purple earl the purplish side of red and a bit more vibrant and theres fraying at the edges of the fabric where some of the leaves come undone where is that and the that fabric that is it looks like edge is already there when its like that looks great as well and less than the last especially when youre complaining like a straight line or like in line with the grain of the fabric like that is very tightly woven if you pull diagonal theres more stretch yes its also the case here actual strands of the fabric works come or were starting to fray the threads are or thinner in this one than the last one and then this is false there arent like individual because i think in the process of felting break up individual threads play 4 new substrate im not actually entirely sure how this made this is all guesses

'ok ok gotchano yeah sounds good so these 201204 all seem to be spherical objects balls of some sort and toys too this 202 looks like a lacrosse ball but its not this 204 i see is a hacky sack which ive played with before lets see i think this 203 one might be my favorite because its 203 like the weirdest and it 203 has like sucker shapes like a octopus tentacle might have and multicolored um yeah red green blue this 201 one this 201 ones also texturally interesting i think that all 201 202 203 of them except for the hacky sack 204 are really texturally interesting in my opinion drops 201204 in turn this 202 one ooh oh shoot it 201 lights up yes these 201 202 two are bouncy these 203 204 two are not i love how this 201 lights up wow thats 201 cute um these 201 203 two seem to be made of plastic this 202 one is made of rubber it 202 kind of reminds me of a pencil eraser in terms of like the color and the feel and the texture honestly its 202 just like a like a pencil eraser yeah this 204 ones it 204 looks knitted or crocheted or some sort of like string craft and 204 seems to be filled with beads and yeah like probably plastic beads is my guess its 204 not very bouncy but its 204 softer than the other ones 201203 i feel like you could buy all of these 201204 at like the dollar store or something this 202 one says its high bounce but i feel like it should bounce higher than it does ive definitely seen bouncy balls that bounce higher 202 disappointing 202 disappointing i really dont know what the purpose of this 203 one is though like this 203 is i guess it 203 might stick to the wall or something yeah i i feel like my favorite one after further investigation was probably the light up one 201 because its the most exciting i would say yeah i feel like i i had everything as a kid i had these 201 202 204 three balls but not this 203 ive never seen anything like that 203 one before um what elseyeah ok oh my gosh this 207 ones fun dang oh my gosh ok ok i love how wow i love how intricate this 206 one is like i wonder how they made it 206 because its just like all interlocked i feel like it would have been hard like i dont know how they made it 206 like wow wow and 206 surprisingly bouncy ok this 205 one also is very similar to these 205 206 two are very similar i i this 205 ones also also i dont know how they made this 205 one its 205 a little more random in its bounce i think i like this 206 one better because its 206 a little more predictable and its a little smoother and i like the deep the deeper colors of this 206 one better its 206 more vibrant this 208 is a globe wow its 208 actually labeled with everything thats cool um yeah dang seems oh theres 208 like an indent on one side i wonder if thats purposeful is that it or is that a mistake i guess so that it 208 could oh it 208 could sit up interesting this is probably i mean its it 208 was made in the us or or for the us i guess because these can see from like the us perspective like the world like because theres no like it doesnt sit like this it sits with the us in the front interesting that could be a bias but thats thats cool im impressed that they got the like little writing on it 208 not not a bad not a bad one 208 thats thats a fair i would say its 208 solid this 207 one is interesting i it it seems to like part in two which is a little like my ocdness im like it should be more spherical i do like the yellow and green 207 its a good color combination and it is fun to play with like i feel like i could use this as a distressor like makes a fun noise its 207 like a pompom 207 like a cheerleader pompom or like it 207 reminds me of sea urchin actually too but 207 definitely softer than a sea urchin would be thankfully 207 not very bouncy i this 205 one i feel like would be fun to play with because it 205 bounces so like unpredictively so it could be like a fun game to like pass it 205 to someone this 206 one i have to say this 206 one takes the cake its just its its 206 my favorite because its 206 the most its 206 smooth its like the colors are nice like its interesting this 205 ones interesting too but i dont know i just like this 206 one better somehow and the globe 208 is its very light actually wow i didnt notice that before foamy 208 when i squeeze that 208 i feel air come out yeah thats what i got for now yeah dang ok this 211 whoa this 211 is so cool whoa oh my gosh its like theyre swimming through the water 211 thats so cool 211 whoa picks up 211 and it slips out of her hands oh my gosh whoa thats so oh my god you gotta oh my gosh whoa thats i love this 211 its 211 like very slippery oh my what this 211 is kind of ingenious im not going to lie its 211 so simple but like its movement is very satisfying and the well dolphins theyre so cute though ok this 211 is so cool i like wow i wish i had this 211 as a kid i would have loved that um wow ok definitely that ones 211 the best one this 210 is a brain 210 dark purple brain it looks like um not to scale but i wonder what the druthers company is druthers pronouncing it differently than before i dont know but ok it 210 kind of it looks like a computer mouse to me ok moving on this 212 seems to be a bead could be on like a bracelet maybe taps 212 against table very solid i like the red color it 212 reminds me of valentines day and its 212 nice and sparkly inside too it 212 kind of looks like it should be edible like it looks like if candy like maybe cherry or strawberry flavored yeah its 212 nice but if it 212 was on a bracelet it 212 would be sideways which would be a little bothersome to me yeah i think its made of glass taps 212 against table that would be my guess it 212 reminds me of a stone too like like a polished stone that you could find on the beach or something and this 209 guy is a little alien oh i like how you you can bend its 209 arms ok its it it 209 has some character i would say and yeah i think theres a wire inside or something that is holding it 209 in place when you move it 209 around um i personally think the head of this 209 alien is a little too big i think it it well i mean i guess an alien is supposed to look weird but it looks weird to me and it i mean it it 209 has a kind of devious smile im its kind of i dont know unsettling and some a little way a little bit to me yeah yeah i wanna play with this 211 more oh my gosh this 211 one i think the sound also adds to the quality of the toy because it sounds like something swimming you hear the water its really just wow very oh my god drops 211 off table oh my god ok there are three dolphins in here 211 they all look the same they are all very adorable and yeah wonder what what liquids inside 211 if its i mean its probably just water but some sparkles and i think probably a blue dye color because i think the plastic is clear so i think the water is dyed blue how did they get the water in here 211 and i that thats just amazing like with i dont know if i can reference those but like yeah with all the toys like with like these 205 206 two and this 211 one im like i dont know how they made it you knowso its pretty impressive honestly engineering feat ok ok wow that ones 211 definitely my favorite yeah i thinkok cooloh my gosh wow these 213216 are beautiful oh my gosh i think i had a coin purse like this 213216yeah when i was younger ok theyre 213216 filled with things this 213 one feels like its filled with the largest objects maybe like a pea or a bean of some of some type all right this 216 one this one feels like its filled with sand and this 214 one also hmm it 214 feels like its filled with something slightly coarser than sand hmm maybe like small plastic beads these 213 215 feel very similar they 213 215 might be filled with i dont know i think theyre different things but theyre the similar shape this 215 one these feel like crunchier and drier i dont know but i like how these 213216 look like all together its very visually aesthetically pleasing theyre beautiful i love the how these 215 216 two have like the shiny threads throughout them give them 215 216 like more elegance but these 213 214 also have like the simplicity of just the the satin color and the like its less i dont know loud than these 215 216 as these 215 216 are i like the butterflies 213 214 and i think theres yeah i think thats a butterfly 214 yeah theyre 213216 very nice very like elegant and i would say they 213216 seem like feminine in what i in my like understanding of the feminism and masculinity and stuff but yeah and i i do yeah these 215 216 i dont know which one my favorite would be probably i would probably go with this 213 one cause i do like the the pink color um like personally if i had to choose one to like use as a coin purse i would probably go with the pink one 213 because these these 215 216 ones are beautiful but theyre not really like my style theyre 215 216 a bit too like intricate and detailed and elegant i suppose it doesnt really go with my style but like butterflies and like simple patterns more so for me these 213216 they seem to be made like by the same company or person or something because theyre like they 213216 have the same structure which is actually i dont know its pretty satisfying to see like you know four of the same structured coin purse i guess like but just like but theyre 213216 very different too so its cool yeah i guess yeah thats all i have to saynice so these 217220 are all pieces of fabric of about the same size rectangular shapes 217220 um and yeah theyre 217220 just theyre pieces of you know swaths of fabric that arent hemmed or like made to be a napkin or a bandana or anything these 218 219 two are similar in material theyre 218 219 both similar material these 217 220 two are like the outliers i would say this 220 really is lacelike but its very its like a stretchy material too which i feel like it could be made and it could be incorporated into a piece of clothing or something cause that stretchiness is often nice for making clothes i think this 217 is like a piece of felt which i i feel like this would be less commonly used to make clothing but more maybe for like arts and crafts or like something like that but yes i do like the red color 217 its reminding me of christmas and holidays yeah and then i think oh this 219 has a very faint pattern i thought this side was like the underneath but um gold sort of squiggles and like light white squiggles as well and see this is the edge of the fabric probably would you would probably cut that off if you wanted to make something out of this 219 yeah 219 not stretchy at all really um same with this 218 one also not stretchy i feel like you could make like a tablecloth or napkin out of this 218 same with this 219 i mean and i think you could make like a dress or skirt of these 218 219 as well but it would be less i feel like clothing that you find in stores has more of this 220 stretchy material than just like straight 219 like i dont know if this is maybe cotton or not sure i used i used to do sewing take sewing lessons so i made a skirt out of material like this 218 but like the skirt i made was it definitely felt like it was homemade like it wasnt it wasnt like a storebought thing because it was less stretchy and yeah less professionally done but yeah i would say i have to go with i think i like these 218 220 two like as in a combination like maybe putting this 220 over this 218 one is kinda nice like the the deep like red wine color 218 is pretty elegant very pleasing i guess its a maroon 218 go maroons and then yeah the lace 220 is just like light delicate seeming nice touch and i feel like they 218 220 complement each other well yeah but if i choose one fabric that was my favorite id probably go with the lace 220 its 220 just its just fun it 220 has i think the most fun texture too probably my least favorites the felt 220 just because its more like i dont know its 217 less elegant its 217 less like fancy its 217 you know its just felt its material more so than like artistic or i mean yeah and it 217 feels a little more a little more childish because it 217 reminds me of like arts and crafts and like making stuff out of felt and stuff in elementary school or something so yeah this 219 one i feel like the pattern isnt the most isnt my favorite like its just a little too light for me and like a little too random yeah but i mean its not bad but i it doesnt like im not like super aesthetically its 219 not super aesthetically pleasing to me although it 219 does kind of go well with the burgundy color 218 i feel like just like a light colored fabric against the like darker background is nice these 219 220 dont go well together though thats like a clashing patterns nope thats not it and this 217 220 just looks weird i dont know because theyre 217 220 just like on the opposite ends of the spectrum yeah okalright lets do it ooh thats 222 soft this 222 is very soft i have a jacket made out of very similar material 222wow this 223 is like faux fur of some sort velvet 221 very shiny or i dont know if its real velvet or probably not but its 221 like very shiny i like how the light like reflects off of it 221 differently based on so it kind of gives it 221 like shimmery look its very pleasing this 224 ok wow interesting like reminds me of i dont know if it 224 is burlap but i feel like it it 224 feels like burlap like a sack like a sack of potatoes could be made out of this definitely 224 the least fun one to touch and look at it but i mean you know it 224 could be like a rustic place mat or something at a dining table uh this 224 ones scratchy like yeah seems seems the its 224 the least pleasing to me this 222 one is so soft oh my gosh wow both sides are very soft but different like the top one the top part is little squishier when you flip it 222 over its just like like a a layer of fuzz kind of soft its less like pillowy and squishy is just like soft hmm it was i think its interesting so i guess its interesting that like in the middle like these 209212 this one this round 209212 with like the alien 209 and the heart 212 and the and the brain 210 and the dolphins 211 that was probably the one where it was like the most random like and the other ones theres at least like a theme like fabrics 217224 coin purses 213216 balls 201208 and then this 209212 one is just kind of like random stuff like they 209212 werent even really the same size like um very different textures and like uses and um yeah definitely i i would say that 209212 one was the most like not the most interesting but like the the most surprising that like 209212 round and then yeah i definitely i felt like i was like i just wanted to touch everything like it was very textural experience and like yeah i feel like a good toy it has a good texture it really it really puts puts it above everything so i think its interesting that there was like two rounds 201208 that had balls and then two rounds 217224 that had fabrics um only one 213216 of coin purses um but yeah i think thats

its interesting that like in the middle like these 209212 this one this round 209212 with like the Alien 209 and the Heart 212 and the and the Brain 210 and the Dolphins 211 that was probably the one where it was like the most random like and the other ones theres at least like a theme like fabrics 217224, coin purses 213216, balls 201208 and then this 209212 one is just kind of like random stuff like they 209212 werent even really the same size like um very different textures and like uses and um yeah definitely I I would say that 209212 one was the most like not the most interesting but like the the most surprising that like 209212 round and then yeah I definitely I felt like I was like I just wanted to touch everything like it was very textural experience and like yeah I feel like a good toy.', 'It has a good texture it really it really puts puts it above everything.', 'So I think its interesting that there was like two rounds 201208 that had balls and then two rounds 217224 that had fabrics.', 'Um, only one 213216 of coin purses.', 'Um, but yeah I think thats I guess.']}, '132': {'statements': 'makes sensetheyre 201204 so cute can i go in like order um 202 seems to be bouncy ball pink bouncy ball kind of a rubber eraser color um its 202 a little firm probably because it needs to bounce i wish it 202 was a little squishier but i think the other ones are here for that this 201 one is a little squishier but a little like less fun to touch because of the like porcupine aspect of it i think its cool though like how you can look inside 201 and see inside of it which i like the fact that you can know about it 201know all about it because you can also see kind of where they insert the air i thinkthe hole um honestly i feel like the circle like the sphere 201 itself is smaller than the bouncy ball 202 but with the porcupines its 201 like comparable in surface area yes surface area oh this 203 is so fun this 203 is like this 201 but like more condensed in a way because like the sphere 203 thats the central shape is so so small and it 203 also has this porcupine kind of thing coming out of it except its not spiky its more like whats the word suction suctiony um think its 203 fun though because its three separate colors and it 203 feels like kind of hemispherical in that theres like red at the top the equator is the blue and the green is the bottom of the top whichever one i think this 203 would be like fun to play with in like a bathtub and just like throw it 203 watch it stick um i dont know i like it 203 it 203 feels like malleable not as malleable as this 201 but like i can still like squish it 203 and transform it 203 and then this this 204 is so fun i actually really enjoy this 204 its 204 giving like tribal patterns with the like whats it called not only the colors but also the shapes that are formed by the colors so theres like parallelogram no what is it yeah i guess like diamond parallelogram thing and the the repeating of the shapes gives it a sense of like almost a rhythm i dont know it kind of reminds me of the the casing they put on like drums and like you know like they dress it almost so i dont know exactly what culture to think of but also just like that you can like obviously its 204 squishy but not super squishy because the fabric is not very stretchy but at the same time you can feel that its madeup of smaller smaller balls so yeah i mean theyre all 201204 like spherical balllike where i would say this 202 is the most like true to a normal spherical ball and this 204 is probably the least spherical because its a little bit more flat on either end more cylindrical but i think this 203 is the greatest departure from a sphere because its although you can perceive it 203 as a sphere theres just so much more going on here so yeah yeah i think sorolls 203 201 and 202 to 000 and as we had discussed this 204 wont do that sooklets go oh my god these 205208 are so fun so i would just right off like first impression these 205 206 two feel like sciencey to me maybe because they look like a molecule of some kind or i dont know theyre 205 206 like intertwined like if i cut one of the the flower shapes or star shapes like they would all just fall apart interesting i feel like this 206 is more squishy than this 205 one even though ive dont know but theyre theyre 205 206 still like spheres kind of like the first group where they give you a general sense of like a circle i dont know the colors 205 206 are really nice i like how vibrant they 205 206 are and that theyre 205 206 kind of transparent so its all kind of melding into one because even like through the purple you can see the blue behind it um and its very i feel like its 206 a gentle gentle object maybe because of like the curves and now its 206 just kind of flowing whereas this 205 one seems like crazy probably because even though this 206 appears to be a star or like a flower of some kind like the main shape that is repeated this 205 is like obviously a star because the points are defined and the lines are straight versus this 206 where its curved and its 205 similar in that its 205 just like a bunch of stars put together and if you were to make an incision in one place i feel like it would fall apart but i think the colors 205 are a little subdued i dont know if thats because theres more surface area here 205 like within each shape like this 206 is just thicker and or sorry this 206 has more no this 205 has more surface area and so like this 206 is denser in the color in a way like the pink the pink is standing out a lot because it just seems so much lighter here 205 but then it 205 also seems more transparent and like here 206 it was you could see the difference in colors here 205 i feel like theyre all just kind of blending into one if you look through like one specific color so i i dont like that theres no contrast 205 so i wish they were like brighter especially because theres so much going on here 205 ok moving on i actually subgrouped them myself yeah actually these 207 208 dont anyway this 208 is so cute and i will once youre done with this project if i could have this 208 this 208 is this reminds me of the the the ball bouncy ball 202 from the first group in that its a sphere and i dont know theres no you know whats it called whats the word like jagged surface like theres no texture on it 208 really i also think its interesting that right near australia it is flattened to probably depict i dont know scientifically accurate this is but the tilt of the earths axis um and i think compared to the bouncy ball 202 this 208 is more decorative than it is like to play with although i think you can also just squish this too and we can hear that theres a little bit of air being released every time you squish it 208 but i think yeah this 208 is more decorative because it has like almost like a way for it to sit and you can just look at it and be like i wanna travel here next so yeah i mean i i think the only thing i dont like about it 208 is that its inaccurate like in terms of the worlds not this shape like isnt it not like a perfect sphere i dont know but yeah i really like this 208 one and also when you like squish it 208 the image of the world of the globe on the ball like scrunches up and its funny because its like so destroying and then finally this 207 um this 207 is still in a way like a sphere if you were to hold it up by like one singular i dont even know to call it like hair its still forming like some kind of sphere but this 207 is just the most like openended object so far because you could just morph it into whatever you want like i feel like this 207 if i do something like this pulls strings together it 207 looks more like a brush or broom of some kind or like toothbrush that really looks like a toothbrush i also think the colors i like the color choice in this 207 because yellow and green are so similar and so i like how theyre all blending together and they almost because theres so many of them theyre almost seems to be a separate color that theyre creating together i dont i dont know anything about the color wheels so i dont know what color that is but its just like its a nice greenish the reason its 207 also spherical is because i cant see it but theres something in the middle kind of where theyre all attached to and where theyre all coming out of and im like inclined to say that that is just like a really small ball like the the the suction one 203 from the last group that was like a tiny tiny ball in the middle and then things coming off of it um i dont know think its 207 fun to play with but yeah i dont have many feelings on this 207 one i think its 207 cool but i i wouldnt gravitate towards this 207 yeah i think the major thing that ties them all together even in this 205208 group is the spherical shape and theres a lot besides the suction one 203 theres a lot more like vibrant colors in this 205208 group especially with the two like rubber ones 205 206 here but even just the globe 208 which its like mostly water because its how the earth is but its nice and blue and this 207 is green and yellow so i think it 205208 provides a lot more like vibrant colors that 201204 still has a lot of colors but its not necessarily vibrant so yeahthis 211 is so so fun im kind of happy to see nonspheresnonsphereslike how can i say spheres um this 211 like immediately caught my eye because the moment i tried to touch it it escaped me but yeah i mean i saw sharks or dolphins no those are dolphins in here and i kind of wanted to see if i could touch it from the outside plastic but it just i dont have the opportunity because it wont let me but i think this 211 is so interesting like its i dont know its ever changing because it doesnt stay in one position but it still occupies like the same amount of space and general shape of like a cylinder i think that its 211 also unique compared to anything else weve seen because theres like a its its a liquid suspended within a solid and and i dont know theres a little bit in there 211 but its a lot of fun i think that even the color the blue is very nice peaceful and reminds me of the ocean or like a swimming pool probably but yeah no i really enjoy this 211 one ok its 210 a little bit more dense than the globe 208 which is interesting i dont know if thats because of the shape of it 210 or just the like the the material is different and its 210 obviously a brain i think and its 210 also super symmetrical which like is pretty common of brains i think but i guess ive never seen one this close i dont know it 210 just feels like feels a little too firm like i dont like how firm this 210 is kind of the rubber ball 202 or the bouncy ball 202 which was meant to bounce but and this is does not bounce to my knowledge not quite hold on i guess it 210 does bounce a little bit but yeah its just also probably an aesthetic thing kind of like the globe 208 and i dont know if thats just because of the material or because this 210 also has like a flat edge where it can just sit um and cant ignore the fact that its labeled or branded so be probably something thatd be given away like at this druthers companyyeah i think soits hard to hold on to it 211 i mean there seems to be a pattern in those groups so im assuming were not allowed to open them right cause its interesting so these 213216 are im not really sure like what culture or like societal group these 213216 come from but they seem to be just like coin pouches i wanna say theyre 213216 from like east asia but i dont i dont really know but theyre all kind of the handiwork is all the same in terms of the structure of it in that it has like a metal encasing and that it keeps it closed with this like spherical locker thing but i think on the outside there are differences the red one 213 and the black one 214 seem to be just variations of the same thing in that they 213 214 have like butterflies or dragonflies or something or some like supernatural fly or butterfly as a common repeating pattern and the they 213 214 seem to not only have one main color as the background for this 214 its black for this 213 its red but also the main color or main few colors besides black here 214 are like silver and gold and then a little bit of pink whereas they could have you know just made every image a completely different color just to signify like different animals but its just like all the same kind of animal or insect and then here 213 its similar in that they chose like this i dont even know what to call it like rose gold and that seems to be their common color and little bit of actual gold so i think thats interesting that they stick to like a general theme within the coin pouch 213 214 and then still sticking with the outside like this 215 216 is i would if i had a subgroup this id put the red 213 and black 214 one in one and then these 215 216 two in one these 213 214 are also i should say theyre like satin feeling and just very smooth and silky and then these 215 216 are a little bit more textured theyre not as smooth to the touch this i mean theyre 215 216 very intricate and a lot is going on but i think that this 215 reminds me of like a peacock with the spiraling of the the pattern and yeah just very ornate and but similarly to the other two 213 214 i think like theres a base color which is blue for this 215 and then they use like gold and red or pink to embellish it further and for this 216 i actually i dont know if thats my mind playing games on me but i feel like this 216 is smoother even though they 215 216 appear to be like the same like craftsmanship um but yeah i just i mean this 216 ones gold and its its probably the most cohesive one out of the four 213216 in that it 216 just sticks with gold or different shades of gold and yellow and a little bit of white so even though these 213 214 are solid colors i would say this 216 is the most like like centered on one color and then for whats inside im so interested because these are not coins so this 214 one i feel like every time i touch it 214 it feels like rice and or like grains of some kind and i think that also changes the experience of looking at or yeah like touching it and then looking at it 214 because like for example these 215 216 which i havent estimated what they may be yet but this 216 feels so much like fuller like physically whereas this 215 seems a little less full and this 216 one feels like it weighs more oh my god this 216 may be rice what the heck they 214 216 might both be rice but so yeah because this these 213 215 two seem very similar in texture of whats inside but this 213 seems more full and also kind of seems smaller i dont know im really curious like i dont know if its like lentils or beans 215 or is it something like peppercorns maybe i i like them 213216 i think theyre pretty but its its im almost like frustrated because i cant find now whats inside of them yeah i know youll have to tell me later but i would say that theyre are since theyre 213216 all like similar like objects in terms of shape like its important to note that they 213216 kind of have the ability to sit upright if full enough and full with the right thing cause like this 213 which i feel like might is a little bit more weighted is able to stand upright whereas this 214 is like not so much but here 214 216 if im im thinking that these the inside objects are the same then this 216 is able to stand upright just by the weight of it so yeah its just also when theres less in it it seems to be bigger and theres more in it it seems really small even though its like wider i think thats itok so were veering further and further away from the spheres its so sad but um yeah these 217220 are just like some fabrics start with this 220 one um its 220 lace um it 220 reminds me maybe because of the color and maybe because of the way its decorated but reminds me of like table cloth its 220 transparent like i dont know maybe not im trying to look through the design itself but lace by nature is transparent just because it has mesh but if you look on if you look at it 220 this way it feels very pretty because the the i dont know the material used is shiny and like reflective and light like it i think so i cant tell but when you look at the back 220 its like kind of dull and obviously you can see the the like craft work that went into this because this is kind of you know the back of the canvas whereas this is the front um think its 220 like a rectangle yeah its a rectangle thank god um but its 220 not entirely even and also its 220 like fraying at some of the ends which i dont know its like its 220 imperfect but theres nothing wrong with that i guess yeah so i would say this 220 is like mostly all like white or like silver with white um yeah and thats what i have to say about thatout of any object but its 217 just like felt um and it 217 feels very strong like i feel like im putting a lot of force into ripping it apart um but its you know pretty malleable kind of like those a lot of the group one 201204 and group two 205208 where the objects were kind of like pull and push as you please to create your desired object but yeah i feel like if you look really closely 217 which i guess ive never looked this close at felt but it just it seems like theres so many individual fibers within the felt 217 that makes me realize that it feels like even though its 217 just this one thing and its very monotone as a whole its 217 made up of very intricate like mesh meshing mesh of different fibers and stuff but yeah thats what i have to say about that 217but ive never scrapbooked so i dont know but its also i would say like if i had to organize them in like size i think lace 220 would be the biggest this 218 would be the next the maroon and then i think these 217 219 are pretty comparable i dont know i think the red 217 might be more but yeahok ooh this 222 might be my favorite thing that its 222 just its so soft and i dont know what the material is but its like mimicking wool or like sheeps fur or something and its 222 almost like warm to the touch because i think it retains body heat really well but it 223 doesnt provide me the comfort that this 222 does i think because this 222 was a little bit more predictable and this 223 just seems like i could touch it and would just fly away so and then this 224 i dont know what this 224 is like i dont know it 224 reminds me of cheese cloth maybe but ive never really used cheesecloth so i dont know its kind of like a dark gray its not necessarily black i dont think and it 224 kind of moves in groups because of the way its sewn or created so if you push any which side it like they all that whole area moves along with it i also dont find comfort in the fact that its 224 seethrough like i dont i dont like that because i want i dont know i guess i just compare everything to the white one 222 but its it 224 just feels very like frail and its like here its 224 super light its super thin the texture is also not like very comforting so it was kind of rough to the touch but i feel like it is one of the like stronger materials weve seen here 221224 because if i scrunched up the other one that like besides well actually maybe like this 223 one if i scrunch it up it creates texture in the fabric or in the the hair this 221 one if you scrunch it up it like moves away and this 222 one also but this 224 like you could scrunch it up and release it and it 224 stays in that original position which makes it really unique and i think the in that group 1234 4 217220 it focuses a lot more on like actually let me say this like this 221224 group focuses a lot more on texture versus that 217220 i think the lace has a little bit of texture with the other ones 217219 um i was kind of looking at the shape and the color and stuff versus here 221224 the texture is really screaming my name and like touching them 221224 so yeahum should i like give superlatives oh yeah um i like this 211 one i think this 211 is just so unique even though ive definitely played with this before in my life but its just its so fun and i think a lot of the point of these things especially in the early on groups is kind of distraction like theyre like things you have to hold like fidgets fidget thingy whatever its called like not not a fidget spinner but like fidgeting and this 211 is the most unique because i feel like i could fidget and the alien 209 guy i guess but um yeah we went its interesting we went from like spheres to like like rectangle i dont know like flat and large objects yep', 'sentence-tokens': ['Makes sensetheyre 201204 So cute!', 'Can I go in like order?', 'Um 202 seems to be bouncy ball, pink, bouncy ball, kind of a rubber eraser color.', 'Um, its 202.', 'A little firm, probably because it needs to bounce.', 'I wish it 202 was a little squishier, but I think the other ones are here for that.', 'This 201 one is a little squishier but a little like less fun to touch because of the like porcupine aspect of it.', 'I think its cool though.', 'like how you can look inside 201 and see inside of it which I like the fact that you can know about it 201know all about it because you can also see kind of where they insert the air I thinkthe hole.', 'Um honestly I feel like the circle like the sphere 201 itself is smaller than the bouncy ball 202 but with the porcupines its 201 like comparable in surface area.', 'Yes, surface area.', 'Oh this 203 is so fun.', 'This 203 is like this 201 but like more condensed in a way because like the sphere 203, thats the central shape is so so small.', 'and it 203 also has this porcupine kind of thing coming out of it except its not spiky.', 'Its more like whats the word suction suctiony?', 'Um think its 203. fun though because its three separate colors and it 203 feels like kind of hemispherical in that theres like red at the top, the equator is the blue and the green is the bottom of the top.', 'Whichever one I think this 203 would be like fun to play with in like a bathtub and just like throw it 203, watch it stick.', 'Um I dont know.', 'I like it 203.', 'It 203 feels like malleable.', 'not as malleable as this 201 but like I can still like squish it 203 and transform it 203 and then this.', 'This 204 is so fun.', 'I actually really enjoy this 204.', 'Its 204 giving like tribal patterns with the like whats it called not only the colors but also the shapes that are formed by the colors.', 'So theres like parallelogram.', 'no what is it?', 'yeah I guess like diamond parallelogram thing and the the repeating of the shapes gives it a sense of like almost a rhythm.', 'I dont know.', 'It kind of reminds me of the the casing they put on like drums and like you know like they dress it almost so I dont know exactly what culture to think of but also just like that you can like obviously its 204 squishy but not super squishy because the fabric is not very stretchy but at the same time you can feel that its madeup of smaller smaller balls.', 'So yeah I mean theyre all 201204 like spherical balllike.', 'Where I would say this 202 is the most like true to a normal spherical ball and this 204 is probably the least spherical because its a little bit more flat on either end, more cylindrical.', 'But I think this 203 is the greatest departure from a sphere because its although you can perceive it 203 as a sphere, Theres just so much more going on here.', 'So yeah, yeah, I think sorolls 203 201 and 202 to 000.', 'And as we had discussed this 204 wont do that.', 'Sooklets go.', 'Oh my God.', 'these 205208 are so fun.', 'So I would just right off.', 'Like first impression, these 205 206 two feel like sciencey to me.', 'Maybe because they look like a molecule of some kind.', 'or I dont know.', 'theyre 205 206.', 'Like intertwined like if I cut one of the the flower shapes or star shapes like they would all just fall apart.', 'Interesting.', 'I feel like this 206 is more squishy than this 205 one even though Ive dont know.', 'but theyre theyre 205 206. still like spheres, kind of like the first group where they give you a general sense of like a circle.', 'I dont know.', 'The colors 205 206 are really nice.', 'I like how vibrant they 205 206 are and that theyre 205 206 kind of transparent.', 'so its all kind of melding into one because even like through the purple, you can see the blue behind it.', 'Um, and its very I feel like its 206, a gentle gentle object.', 'Maybe because of like the curves and now its 206, just kind of flowing.', 'Whereas this 205 one seems like crazy.', 'Probably because even though this 206 appears to be a star or like a flower of some kind like the main shape that is repeated, this 205 is like obviously a star because the points are defined and the lines are straight versus this 206 where its curved and its 205.', 'Similar in that its 205 just like a bunch of stars put together.', 'and if you were to make an incision in one place, I feel like it would fall apart.', 'But I think the colors 205 are a little subdued.', 'I dont know if thats because theres more surface area here.', '205 Like within each shape.', 'Like this, 206 is just thicker and or sorry, this 206 has more.', 'No, this 205 has more surface area and so like this 206 is denser in the color in a way like the pink.', 'The pink is standing out a lot because it just seems so much lighter here 205.', 'But then it 205 also seems more transparent and like here 206 it was.', 'You could see the difference in colors here 205.', 'I feel like theyre all just kind of blending into one if you look through like one specific color.', 'So I I dont like that.', 'theres no contrast 205 so I wish they were like brighter.', 'especially because theres so much going on here.', '205 Ok, moving on.', 'I actually subgrouped them myself.', 'Yeah, actually these 207 208 dont.', 'Anyway, this 208 is so cute and I will once youre done with this project.', 'If I could have this 208, this 208 is this reminds me of the the the Ball Bouncy ball 202 from the first group in that its a sphere and I dont know.', 'Theres no, you know whats it called?', 'whats the word like jagged surface like theres no texture on it?', '208 really.', 'I also think its interesting that right near Australia it is flattened to probably depict.', 'I dont know scientifically accurate this is but the tilt of the earths axis.', 'Um, and I think compared to the Bouncy ball 202, this 208 is more decorative than it is like to play with.', 'although I think you can also just squish this too.', 'And we can hear that theres a little bit of air being released every time you squish it.', '208.', 'But I think yeah, this 208 is more decorative because it has like almost like a way for it to sit and you can just look at it and be like i wanna travel here next.', 'So yeah I mean I I think the only thing I dont like about it 208 is that its inaccurate.', 'Like in terms of the worlds, not this shape like isnt it not like a perfect sphere.', 'I dont know.', 'but yeah I really like this 208 one.', 'and also when you like squish it 208 the image of the world of the globe on the ball like scrunches up and its funny because its like so destroying.',

feel like Im putting a lot of force into ripping it apart.', 'um but its you know pretty malleable.', 'kind of like those a lot of the Group One 201204 and group Two 205208 where the objects were kind of like pull and push as you please to create your desired object.', 'But yeah I feel like if you look really closely 217 which I guess Ive never looked this close at felt.', 'but it just it seems like theres so many individual fibers within the Felt 217 that makes me realize that it feels like even though its 217.', 'Just this one thing.', 'and its very monotone As a whole.', 'its 217 made up of very intricate like mesh meshing mesh of different fibers and stuff.', 'But yeah, thats what I have to say about that 217but Ive never scrapbooked so I dont know.', 'But its also I would say like if I had to organize them in like size, I think Lace 220 would be the biggest, this 218 would be the next.', 'The maroon and then I think these 217 219 are pretty comparable.', 'I dont know, I think the Red 217 might be more, but yeahok ooh this 222 might be my favorite thing that its 222.', 'Just.', 'its so soft and I dont know what the material is, but its like mimicking wool or like sheeps fur or something.', 'And its 222.', 'Almost like warm to the touch because I think it retains body heat really well.', 'But it 223 doesnt provide me the comfort that this 222 does.', 'I think because this 222 was a little bit more predictable and this 223 just seems like I could touch it and would just fly away.', 'So and then this 224.', 'I dont know what this 224 is like.', 'I dont know.', 'It 224 reminds me of cheese cloth.', 'maybe.', 'but Ive never really used cheesecloth so I dont know.', 'Its kind of like a dark gray, its not necessarily black I dont think.', 'and it 224 kind of moves in

dont.', 'I dont like that because I want.', 'I dont know I guess I just compare everything to the white one 222 but its it 224 just feels very like frail and its like here its 224 super light, its super thin.', 'The texture is also not like very comforting so it was kind of rough to the touch but I feel like it is one of the like stronger materials weve seen here 221224 because if I scrunched up the other one that like besides well actually maybe like this 223 one if I scrunch it up it creates texture in the fabric or in the the hair.', 'this 221 one if you scrunch it up it like moves away

the outside more firm the harder you press its 202 smooth but a little textured like pockmarked this 201 one ooh it lights up but its very spiky and blue it 201 feels nice like kind of like a massage rubbery 201 more squishy less like push back um this 204 one it feels more like dense almost its woven on the outside and a little more textured its 204 oblong as opposed to the other ones 201 202 which were more round this 203 one is sticky kind of yeah with suction cups oh the inside is really hard and then the outside is more flexible and like a rubbery the center of each squish is pretty hard as well ooh its 203 also like kinda sticky like not yeah in an uncomfortable way this 201 one is i like this one this 201 one the best this 202 one also feels pretty dense this 208 one is more like foam and it like rushes air out of this hole its 208 a little tacky it feels like on the edge on the outside this 207 guy is weird like furry kind of i like this 207 one a lot i dont know how to describe it 207 like you can feel all the individual i dont know what to call them furs like hairs almost and its it 207 feels almost like a fluid because it it doesnt like hold it doesnt stay circular and you can kind of push them around these 205 206 two i notice first that theyre almost the same color i guess like color scheme i dont know it 206 feels pretty squishy looks like its 206 about to break yeah i dont these 205 206 ones oh this 205 ones much more like stiff this 206 one squishes more easily this 205 one is more rigid the like prongs dont move like theyre not woven in so it makes it like these 205 206 are kind of painful just like not as nice as these 207 208 ones i think this 207 one is my favorite it 207 feels very like like i said before it feels almost like a fluid like its like moving through your hands and your fingers these 211 are i remember having these 211 these 211 ones are so interesting i it like you can feel the liquid only inside but it also moves like with the liquid so it feels very interesting the dolphins on the inside 211 are fun so yeah its 211 pretty cool its cool in temperature like because of the water ooh its 211 leakingthis 210 is the same oh similar to other world 208 ball its this 210 ones a bit more firm its 210 a bit more dense but the same like air coming out of it its not centralized through you can feel the texture on it 210 like it retains the texture even when you squeeze but its definitely more of a workout than the other one 208 um this 212 one has a hole a little bead its 212 also cool because its stone 212 much more smooth its almost feel it 212 almost feels like candy cause its like hard and smooth but it has ridges on it it 212 is kind of uneven and theres like some sort of shimmer on the inside yeah 212 feels nice and cool whoa this 209 is interesting i dont know what to its like it 209 feels almost like waxy but it holds its shape i dont know this 209 is very interesting it has some texture in the back some yeah this 209 one is the most interesting but it doesnt like fill your hands like the other objects have its more its like piecey with the arms and the legs 209 very interestingi mean i i do like these 211 ones these are fun i wish it 211 was larger i like those really big ones but yeah i can see why these are funthese 213216 are all the same shape different things on the inside so this 215 one feels like small theyre are they uneven yeah theyre like kind of ovalshaped on the inside 215 yeah 215 not very heavy and oh the texture on this 215 is pretty with the like metallic thread its kind of scratchy a bit whereas this 213 this 213 ones more smooth you can feel the embroidery its raised a bit and then these are bigger its 213 also more full than the other one 215 bigger like the beads are bigger 213 and i think its 213 bigger i dont know they 213 215 may be about the same size but this 213 one definitely is heavier oh this 214 has something very fine in it its 214 the same texture as this 213 one these 214 are like really small i dont know this could be 214 its bigger than sand unless its like big pieces of sand but it feels yeah much more not like individual pieces in the same way as these 213 215 two oh this 216 is the same thing 215 or at least similar but just 216 more full yeah and this 216 is the same texture as this 215 lighter one oh and the metal is like cold this 214 one yeah okthese 217220 are all fabrics this 219 is like some sort of cotton its a bit more stretchy but it 219 has metallic in it but its not raised it feels very smooth and theres the border from when it was woven it looks perforated thats interesting its like some thread sticking out 219 but overall really smooth its 219 a bit stretchy its stretchier this way and not the other way interesting 219 217 like felt of some sort its 217 pretty even theres no like warp weft weft and warp weft whatever its 217 like needle felted just a solid sheet its 217 much more textured theres like kind of layers to it 217 like its theres little holes throughout it 217 definitely a little rough but not like gritty and lace 220 on just like a regular background its 220 much more stretchy its 220 almost like netting and the edge of each like image is each flower is raised 220 very shiny theres 220 a little scalloped edge it 220 feels like you can feel all the bumps when you run across them so its yeah this 220 is much more like raised and you can feel each one kind of the delineation when you run across it whereas this 217 one is more like constant constant roughness almost like sandpaper but not not that rough but like the same kind of homogeneity um this 218 one feels very similar to the other one 219 to the white one 219 um less stretchy than the other one 219 and the border is like interesting um this 218 one feels almost a little more like fuzzy than the other cotton one 219 um or maybe not no they feel about no i would say actually this 219 one might feel more fuzzy and this 218 one feels more like just a flat fabric that doesnt have any texture to it yeah theyre 218 219 about the same light so 221224 very different this 224 ones like burlap seems to be black burlap you can feel 224 each part where like the threads overlap cause theres like one part its 224 very rough it could i imagine it 224 would be itchy if you had to wear it and like relatively thin it 224 feels almost like well it feels pretty structured like it 224 kind of can stand up by itself or like retains its shape when you pinch it and stuff this one 222 its some sort of like sherpa but it feels it like feels ok but i could imagine if you like if my hands were dryer i would not like the feeling of it as much its a little like too much to feel i dont know yeah im not a huge fan of that 222 one this 221 is like velvet its very interesting cause you can move the like the fibers around like the pile but it also kind of like its 221 uneven to begin with so its not like you could just like smooth your hand over it you know like it feels uneven with the pile it 221 feels its 221 almost like squishy to press down which is kind of fun and yeah like 221 almost silky at the same time the back seems pretty silky but yeah 221 doesnt really have as much structure as this 224 one this 223 is this 223 one is kind of cool this 223 is like a better version of the sherpa 222 furry theres like two pretty distinct parts to it 223 theres this rough part on the back and then the hair yeah it 223 would be fun to like play with and mess around with um its you can tell its 223 not fur it feels like plasticky and its 223 not itchy but it does have some like how do i describe it like theres a little bit of texture in the fur you can tell its not entirely smooth and that it would tangle after a while yeah and you can go backwards it actually feels better going the other way yeah this 224 almost feels like a like a loofah or something as well its 224 pretty rough like exfoliative 224yepthis 211 ones my favorite i think i keep looking at it and i want to like hold it againyeah it 211 was like it was i liked the feeling of the like fluidity of it it 211 was really fun i was also i guess i was surprised with the like difference in density between the two squishies 208 210 the world 208 and the brain 210 and that the brain 210 like it was firm enough but it still kept the kind of ridges and you could feel it even when you squeezed this 224 fabric these 204 224 are kind of similar if this 224 was more closely like knit i think it 224 would feel like this 204 but its the same kind of like rough like knots almost it feels like i know this 204 is yeah this looks like its 204 crocheted or something like that whereas this 224 is woven but the same knotted

'134': {'statements': 'fair pretty simpleif im way off base im sure youll tell meok im going to start with this one 201 its selfselecting it 201 is squishy but it has soft pokey things its blue it has half cones all the way around to add texture it 201 is opaque you can see through it you can see into it 201 but you cant see out the other side its soft and its very light just a few ounces ooh it 201 lights up i missed that so red and blue internal lights interesting but only when jarred or bounced and it alternates its not always the red or the blue that comes on first it goes back and forth and they both flash ok im done with that one 201 so now im going to come to a giant super ball 202 it has a barcode on it its very bouncy its pink it has a seam it has a water stain on it it is age restricted im significantly older than his age restrictions so thats not a problem it 202 is the pinky high bounce it 202 is about the size of tangerine i would say like more than a clementine but less than an orange so its 202 somewhere kind of in the middle its 202 very soft its smooth the printing is in black yeah nothing special this one 204 is like a hacky sack looks to be done in the jamaican flag sort of color so black yellow green red its soft its round but flattened at the end so its not a perfect sphere the ends are both flattened so it isnt round but it is round around its diameter the it looks like it 204 is crocheted so it feels like its bean bag inside of a crocheted cover but the cover has no opening so you cant take the cover off so it was like it was crocheted around an object this one 203 is sticky and i feel like it will stick to flat surfaces it 203 kind of does and it kind of doesnt if you push hard it can its 203 three colorsgreen blue red it has a hard core center and then it has not really cones but like suction cups coming off of it on stems trying not to break it 203 it 203 will stick to a flat surface i think in theory you could throw it at a wall and it would stick to a wall i think in theory but in reality i dont think it 203 works its not very sticky ok no i feel like you need a bigger toy bagooh ok so far my favorite is the globe 208 squishy ball cause you can smush all the countries this 208 is multicolored it is a fair representation of planet earth however i think it is not taking into account climate change because the ice looks to be too big not enough land i think the scale in some of the countries is off but its 208 squishy its kind of a the surface is is plasticized so its not soft but its and it has an equator seam as well which appears to be in roughly the right place but it isnt in perfect alignment with the actual equator thats printed on the ball 208 so its sort of off center but yeah lots of colors scale is ok but not perfectso this one 207 is bouncy if you hold a single string and bounce but thats it it 207 doesnt bounce on its own ok i love the alien 209 and i love that he 209 is bendy and stretchy back in the 80s we used to have gumbys that did this now we have aliens that do this gumby was the horse hes 209 green he has a ton of holes on his back but i dont know why back and arms he is moldable but he 209 really doesnt sit very well on his own hes a little top heavy and i dont think he can stand on his own either but lets try no i dont think itll happen but you know alien hug and he has the wrong number of fingers and he 209 only has three toes on each foot i thinkthis 211 one is way more interesting because it has sharks in there and so this 211 is a tube filled with a liquid and its 211 divided into two sections three sections one yeah three sections its 211 triangular its 211 hollow well its not hollow but its got a hole through the middle and theres a shark in each one of the three sections 211 the little sharks dont appear to be able to change the section theyre in it rolls it doesnt stand very well its fun to play with and it has little sparklies inside but it 211 does you can like a tube you can sort of squirt it out like that ok i think it 211 leaves marks on the table and then we have a little heart 212 that kind of looks like a candy you can see how its made its got waves or texture through it its got a little shimmer its definitely a choking hazard if you have children or someone who wants to taste things its very hard taps against table it doesnt bounce it has a hole at the bottom and a hole at the top so it could go on a necklace or a string and if you put it on a string it would spin because its hollow in the middlenope im good are you goodalright excellentok purses 213216 which cannot beall but one 213 cannot be opened so you cant open these 213216 these 213216 are coin bags this 216 one is the twist clip at the top i had one of these 216 as a child this 216 one is silver its attached with rubber band at the top it is round its the fabric is kind of a sort of semicircle and then sealed at the sides its filled with beans or feels like bean bags or peas like small plastic things and this 216 is a yellow and gold and white tapestry pattern this 215 one is a swirl pattern this 215 is not as full as the other one 216 it 215 has larger beads on the inside the shape is roughly the same 215 216 the clasp is the same color the colors on this 215 tapestry pattern are more of a swirl with like almost feathers and its 215 blue and yellow and gold and red and the next one 214 is even less full than the last one 215 its 214 black with butterflies the butterflies are kind of bronze silver pink theyre kind of interconnected the shape 214 is roughly the same as the others 215 216 smaller beads 214 not as full and then the last one 213 is probably the fullest of them all 213216 this 213 is the same shape the same style also closed at the top but the rubber band is missing this 213 one is red with pink and green butterflies all over it and it feels like these are more rocklike than beadlike less perfectly round ok ok so now im looking at a piece fabric 218 this is a dark maroon color it in fact appears to be the color of the university of chicago maroon it has fraying edges it appears to be cotton not much give in the warp or the weft its 218 about holds 218 up to forearm to measure i would say 8 inches by 6 inches ish it 218 has creases and fold marks its 218 been in and out of a folded position its 218 not perfectly square ok theres that 218 one the next one 217 is red its felt it 217 is about holds 217 to forearm 5 inches by 8 inches it 217 has a deep crease across the middle this 217 is like bozonose red it 217 is red red it 217 is holding fewer wrinkles to it because its 217 felt both sides 217 are the same color distribution and the same pattern the warp on the weft on this 217 one the weft is definitely more flexible than the warp little bit of give nothing special not super important that 217 one this 220 would be this 220 is a piece of lace it 220 has a ton of texture the backside of the lace is very flat but the front side of the lace is has sort of silver metallic thread through it it is a flower pattern it looks to be like a rose pattern or large rose petals with it a central flower in each one the border 220 is only on one side and its kind of a scallop edge the cut in the fabric 220 is not even um it 220 is fraying on two ends but not all four this 220 one also has some creases and fold marks but it 220 doesnt seem to hold them because this 220 feels like its more nylon polynylon blend it 220 has a lot of stretch in the warp and the weft so yeah pretty 220 surprisingly soft 220 last but not least is a small piece 219 of and this 219 is an edge piece of it feels like cotton and maybe a cottonpoly blend its 219 an edge of a patterned piece of fabric you can see the edge border where it has holes and the green seam it 219 is a cream color with sort of dark gray mottling pattern inside and then a gold kind of floral kind of cloudy pattern to it it 219 is fraying on three of the four edges it 219 has no pattern on the backside since its 219 cotton it 219 holds a ton of its wrinkles and a lot of other fabrics seem to be sticking to it 219 which is also fine but it is fraying so there you go yay ok so this 222 first one very soft and fluffy it 222 feels like fake sheepskin its very fluffy on one side feels like fake sheepskin its very fluffy on one side it is about 6 inches by about 9 inches it on one side it has the texture of sheep fur its 222 very stretchy very soft and squishy and fluffy this 222 would make a great blanketyeah nope i think thats it although i did notice that now the sharks are kind of floating in there 211sort of on their own but other than that no i think thats it theyre fun pieces', 'sentence-tokens': ['Fair.',

'135': {'statements': 'ok ok ok four items theyre 201204 round or theyre not really round theyre kind of ballish like balls they 201204 all have different consistencies this 201 ones kind of pokey and blue and squishy theyre 201204 all kind of squishy theyre all kind of squishy this 202 one bounces actually maybe they all bounce oh not that  one these  three oh this 201 one lights up fancy and i think this 203 one like has suction cups on it and sticks to the table this 201 one is kind of feels a little bit like a stress ball this 202 ones harder it has writing on it it says high bounce pinky and its 202 a little bit you know firmer and more malleable or kind of more kind of tough i guess this 204 one i guess which i would think of as a hacky sack its got more its got a kind of a knitted fashion but in terms of how theyre all the same theyre theyre 201204 kind of round but not not fully round this 204 ones maybe  a little bit off that and they 201204 are toys you could consider maybe toys and they have different like i said different consistencies different sizes this 202 ones the biggest this 203 ones kind of the smallest this 201 ones kind of a got something like what like this one seems like its a little bit hollow and it 201 lights up when you shake it well before it did it had some kind of a light on it i dont know how it did that but maybe its anyway for fun this reminds me of when i was younger and we played hacky sack with it these are like something you get a carnival or maybe at learning express in the dollar section this one is pokey and would be nice to kind of throw around and bounce this is a kind of a bounce you might use it for a specific game like i said how theyre different theyre different colors different sizes a little bit different shape this one is and they have kind of functionally they could serve as toys or kind of like i said stress ball for this one what else anything elseand yeah this one this blue one i guess looking at each one differently separate individually this blue ones got a little triangular pokey things on it and they kind of you push against it they um smells like plastic like i said before when you shake it its got a light in it but its not working right now its got a little kind of thing on the end of it this one here has four different three different colors green blue and red and again it kind of sticks and then you throw it against the thing it sticks to be honest this is like the most fun of the four this one here is it has more kind of really cool colors the same as the kind of the south african flag is this color just if you want to connect it to other colors this one has its dark like a dark green versus this one is more of a kind of a kelly lighter green and this one has red and yellow and has lines and it looks like its a knitted kind of fabric and um it has seems like that some kind of material inside of it where this one is just pulled together by different pieces of like plastic and then this one seems like you know its its a bigger one than on the other four its got a little bit of a blue thing because maybe its got some water damage or something on it and its got a barcode that identifies you know where it came from kind of the town its made in china and again its hard and you threw it against somebody it might hurt them hmm what else pinky i guess its more bouncy than the other ones the material that its made of im not sure what that is maybe theyre all kind of made from these three seem like theyre all kind of made from some kind of plastic where this ones made out of material sewed together in kind of a handmade kind of look and feeli think ive exhausted thatsure oh so ok ok so do just these fourok so these two seem like theyre kind of made from the same material kind of a harder but theyre a little bit different colors this ones these are a little bit more vibrant theyre all these two here together are theyre both of them are pink pink orange green and purple but these are kind of a lighter oh and this ones got blue and blue and this ones got a little bit more muted color to it this is a kind of a round interlocked weaved together kind of feel this one same thing interlocked feel together maybe they come they come apart but its more of a triangle or starish kind of shape where these are more kind of smoother and not so pointy these are all seem where those are seem like theyre more vibrantish colors except maybe the pink even the pink is kind of more vibrant these seem like except for this one these seem more kind of pastelish muted a little bit this is like a squoosh ball which is what we call them its green and yellow and is made of little lines of plasticky material its fun to hold it and kind of this this is oh its a ball i didnt know for sure at first when i looked at it but its really super squishy fun to squish kind of like a stress ball that enoughok so these are all different from each other where the last ones we had were more kind of consistent that there were balls or round toy things where these are maybe still be considered toys but theyre different shapes this is an alien its kind of fun to stretch like you can say theyre all kind of to play with or whatever dodaddies this is like mr alien man this is super fun hes got a nice butt head arms but a little guy that you can walk around and stand here and talk to you this is harder taps 212 against table this is a red heart glass made of glass this right here we used to have these when i was a kid inside of them theyve got like theyve got water inside of them and and this one has like looks like dolphins again something youd win at the fair and then you just kind of you can do it its really fun to like make it blow up and you can get it you know its slippery its slidey and blue its blue and its really kind of a a fun little plastic thing to play with could say ive seen things about it but i wont do that this is a purple brain with some advertising on it it says druthers lets see what it says on it title company oh so its some some kind of a probably something you got like at a conference from but its still like a stress ball similar to the earth one we saw before its nice to just its really relaxing to kind of push on it but it was probably theyre using it for an advertising like a tchotchke you know tchotchke or a cant think what theyre called i cant go anywhere you go to a you know to go to a conference and they give these kind of things so you remember their company and you use their drugs maybe whatever or title company theyre all different shapes so if you look at them together theyre different sizes and shapes these four this ones purple like a vibranty really pretty color of purple with white writing on it shaped like a brain this one here is small a little bit like it could be you know made into a piece of jewelry maybe its got that ability it could its got a hole in the middle of it so maybe it came off piece of jewelry or something like that or through it you could make it into a necklace or a bracelet this one actually has looks like it has some kind of writing inside of it probably just the oh look at that you can stick your finger in it and pull it all the way through and then theres like i said theres writing on it maybe it just says made in china probably thats it its got some sparklies in it and water and its really fun to play with it and to make the little fish little blue look like dolphins swim back and forth in the blue thing mr alien man like i said you can move his hands hes got hands and feet and little holes and part made from hard plastic so this one if you look at them together this glass ones kind of the hardest made out of glass and this is guys kind of a hard plastic this is kind of a softer plasticky kind of squooshy ball and then this is kind of like i said more slippery slidey and kind of can push into it and probably if you pushed hard enough you could make it explode and have water all over sois that itok these are purses little purses they look like theyre all about the same size sizewise maybe a little bit different this one maybe a little different shape maybe they look pretty similar theyre a little bit different fabric these right here have oh i mustnt open it sorry this one has these three have rubber bands on them this one looks like it has rice in it but has something inside of it they they all have different things inside of them where this one feels like its kind of like little rocks maybe but not quite that strong they kind of crunch and they make this fun noise this is and its got blue and red and a pretty gold shiny fabric on it and a really pretty blue but they also have the same similar clasp i think they might be pretty much the same they have a silver or gold i guess its silver anyway they have a metal little the top of it this one i think i cheated because i opened it has rice in it and its yellow with different shades similar kind of metallic shininess to it these materials are silk more silky this one seems like these two things seem like they have the same thing inside of them but theres more in this one this ones fuller its red and its got i dont know if thats like a butterfly maybe butterflies im not sure what that is butterflies butterflies yes butterflies and this one has also butterflyish things similar things maybe theyre not quite the same this ones black and this ones kind of a pinky fuschiay red color and this one maybe its the same thing although it seems a little softer definitely has less in it so in terms of their even though they have even though theyre the same similar things theyre filled with different levels where this one has this one has the most in it then this then this one then this one and then this one but theyre different these two seem like theyre the same things and these are kind of the same things the same maybe rice and these are i dont know like maybe some kind of candy or some kind of maybe little rocks but i think theyre not doesnt seem as strong as rock and they all have well this one doesnt i guess i could look inside of it i dont know if im supposed to the rubber band fell off but they have ok so i wont open it but they all they have kind of a rubber band to close it so i cant open it um thats it i mean theyre theyre really cute little purses like i said theyre different colors different material similar materials two of them are but different very much different colors and kind of which gives you a different look and feelok these are all fabrics theyre different kinds of fabrics all four of them are completely different these are not actually theyre theyre different i mean theyre different fabrics so this is a felt these two are kind of a red tone or this is more of a maroon and this is a kind of a brighter red this is felt this looks like a cotton its got some fraying around and and fabric strings coming around the edges its also sizewise theyre all four different sizes but theyre cut into to different shapes actually theyre pretty similar but this ones bigger so theyre all similar sizes or shapes theyre kind of all kind of square or rectangles more rectangles than squares and oh this ones more of a square theyre all four different materials this is kind of these two are kind of cottony actually so theyre similar but this is maroon and this is kind of a a gold and white with some little dodaddy flowery kind of designs this is a flowery design but but lace they all have kind of most of them except for the felt have some kind of fraying like strings coming off the edge a little bit not so much the the lace and the the felt doesnt umm they all have different texture the lace has got holes in it and is you can kind of feel the pattern of the flowers where this one is these two are solids the felt has got a you know a real soft you know crinkly feel and these two cotton ones are kind of a sleeker smoother feelingwhat else theyre like i said theyre different different kinds of materials different colors different patterns but the similar similarities are that theyre all materials that you could make something out of or do craft with and or cute like little blankets i guessthats good thats good ok so theres four again theyre similar size shapes to the other ones this ones this ones like a longer skinnier where this is more of a square this is fancy yeah theyre these kind of little some pretty similar size this ones are different because its a little bit different shape this one is like is like fur well this one is too but a different kind of fur where this is mainly like a sheep and this is like a goat theyre theyre synthetic but but its kind of a shaggy feel where this is kind of a more like a sheepy kind of feel and then its really soft this one seems like the softest would be a nice blanket this could be a good costume this is a like a this is a velvetish velveteen or something like that and its kind of when you feel its kind of feels a little you kind of makes you feel a little like ew but but its soft also you could make a nice fancy dress and this is burlap um theyre i guess theyre all about the same shape and this one has a more kind of grainy like a harder feeling but like a burlap bag and in terms of colors these two colors are the same or you know similar colors of shades where theyre darker black this is red and this is kind of like a ivory ivory color you can see they have different on the other sides or different this ones all the way through you can you can see through it its got little holes in it and it feels pretty consistent on both sides where this one has kind of a flat smooth feel on one side and a furry very soft kind of fun feel on this side this ones you know softer on this side and well softer on the side with the blanket but but also feels nice here and this one feels is more velvety on one side and its got a variation in colors on the velvet side and its more on the backside just a smooth clear consistent color smooth color one consistent color and then theyre kind of a bias on the side where its cut you know where you cut how they cut the fabric on one side with the scissor marks on kind of most of these you can kind of well not this one yeah some this one has if you pulled you can raveling strings around the outsides and then theres some lint from the other one that got onto it but again its like the other group of groups of fabrics that similarities is that theyre all some kind of a fabricky material and theyre similar these three are similar sizes this ones a little bit different size but but they are kind of squarish or rectangle no theyre fun you could again you could use them for crafts or little doll blankets barbie blankets uh no its kind of a nice except maybe these at the end but everything and most of them are kind of really bright and colorfulthere are things that you know a lot of things that make you happy to look at and kind of a fun a fun mix and array of some things that are same and some that are very much different but theyre all like bright

kind of square or rectangles.', 'more rectangles than squares.', 'and oh, this ones more of a square.', 'Theyre all four different materials.', 'This is kind of.', 'These two are kind of cottony

have kind of.', 'most of them except for the felt have some kind of fraying like strings coming off the edge a little bit, not so much the the lace and the the felt doesnt.', 'umm they all have different texture.', 'The lace has got holes in it and is you can kind of feel the pattern of the flowers where this one is.', 'These two are solids.', 'The felt has got a you know, a real soft, you

theres four.', 'Again, theyre similar size shapes to the other ones.', 'This ones this ones like a longer skinnier where this is more of a square.', 'This is fancy.', 'Yeah theyre these kind of little, some pretty similar size.', 'This ones are different because its a little bit different shape.', 'This one is like is like fur.', 'Well this one is too, but a different kind of fur where this is mainly like a sheep and this is like a goat.', 'Theyre theyre synthetic but but its kind of a shaggy feel where this is kind of a more like a sheepy kind of feel and then its really soft.', 'This one seems like the softest would be a nice blanket.', 'This could be a good costume.', 'This is a like a this is a velvetish velveteen or something like that and its kind of.', 'When you feel its kind of feels a little you kind of makes you feel a little like ew but but its soft.', 'Also you could make a nice fancy dress and this is burlap.', 'um theyre I guess theyre all about the same shape and this one has a more kind of grainy like a harder feeling but like a burlap bag.', 'And in terms of colors these two colors are the same.', 'or you know similar colors of shades where theyre darker black.', 'this is red and this is kind of like a ivory ivory color.', 'You can see they have different on the other sides or different this ones all the way through you can.', 'you can see through it, its got little holes in it and it feels pretty consistent on both sides where this one has kind of a flat smooth feel on one side and a furry very soft kind of fun feel on this side.', 'This ones you know softer on this side and well softer on the side with the blanket but but also feels nice here and this one feels is more velvety on one side and its got a variation in colors on the velvet side and its more on the backside.', 'just a smooth, clear, consistent color, smooth color, one consistent color and then theyre kind of a bias on the side where its cut.', 'you know where you cut, how they cut the fabric on one side with the scissor marks on kind of.', 'most of these you can kind of.', 'well, not this one.', 'yeah some this one has if you pulled you can raveling strings around the outsides and then theres some lint from the other one that got onto it.', 'But again, its like the other group of groups of fabrics that similarities is that theyre all some kind of a fabricky material.', 'and theyre similar.', 'These three are similar sizes, this ones a little bit different size, but but they are kind of squarish or rectangle.', 'No, theyre fun.', 'You could.', 'Again, you could use them for crafts or little doll blankets.', 'Barbie blankets?', 'uh no, its kind of a nice except maybe these at the end.', 'but everything and most of them are kind of really bright and colorfulthere are things that you know a lot of things that make you happy to look at and kind of a fun.', 'A fun mix and array of some things that are same and some that are very much different but theyre all like bright and colorful and kind of fun to touch too.']}, '136': {'statements': 'ok yeah i think so ok yeah ok so i would say that these 201204 four things are all balls of a one type or another some are softer than others this 201 one is flexible but also spiky as well i like the blue color 201 a lot some things about it 201 dont feel good to hold on to its 201 a little spiky but at the same time it kind of provides a good massage for my hand this 203 one is uh interesting for the multi colors red and blue and green the suction cups 203 on the end of each prong are also interesting although although i dont think it 203 feels as good to hold on to in my opinion its 203 also the smallest of the four 201203 this 204 one i would refer to as a hacky sack and i wish that i could effectively keep a hacky sack in the air but im afraid i do not have that talent this 204 one does feel pretty good its its soft and tactile and constructed out of out of the thread gives it a very sort of natural quality that these others 201203 are lacking i like the fact that it 204 feels like it could have been handmade even if it isnt and it reminds me of uh you know family connections to to handicrafts quilters in my family quilters but my mom also crocheted and so theres theres a a certain amount of connection and nostalgia associated with that one i also like the colors 204 lots of different colors umm this 202 one would be fun to play with for sure bouncy 202 and pink and squishy and uh i can imagine playing with a friend or with one of my kids with this but unlike the others i can i can imagine this 202 one hurting if it were to come at me a little too hard i feel like i would have to be more careful with this 202 one to keep it from rolling away its more likely to roll since its perfectly round and uh yeah and the bouncing gives it 202 an element of of surprise and chaosyeah i think so okinteresting ok still 205208 roughly in what i would call the ball category but some of these 205208 i feel like are starting to move away from it this 206 one is very interesting for the rainbow colors for the interweaving of the the plastic rings to form a ball shape its 206 not perfectly round ball its not going to roll very smoothly but it 206 would be fun to play with and theres something pleasing about the geometry of it all and the way it all intertwines all of these shapes i guess six six of the same shape all interlocked this 205 one is rather similar but in a lot of ways but also kind of different its 205 not as shiny its more matte similar colors 205 206 though and a similar idea with the interwoven rings which arent circular theyre star shaped here 205 here 206 theyre more well sort of star sort of flower shaped i guess theyre fivepointed in both cases though which is interesting similarly 205 kind of rolls but a little a little bumpy a little wobbly i think these 205 206 two make a very interesting pair so similar and yet so different i like the squishiness of this 208 round ball globe i like the fact that its 208 a globe as well and i can see all of the parts of the earth this 208 one would be a great one to play with inside its 208 so light and uh it wouldnt hold up very well out in the weather i dont think i think this 208 material would erode more quickly than say this 202 rubber but i think that this 208 one it would be really fun to chase around inside i can imagine my cats wanting to chase that 208 one theyd also be intrigued by this 207 cushy thing koosh ball we used to call these 207 i dont know if theyre still called that this 207 one is very very tactile very interesting to hold on to its 207 spiky but soft in a soft way and you think its its 207 so light but then theres a sort of center weight to it which makes it all the more fun to enjoy and the green and the yellow very bright and colorful i like that 207 yeahwow ok see were moving away from ball territory now weve still got some tactile things 211 going on my son used to love these 211 this 211 one is very squishy and also very hard to hold on to even though its 211 not slippery exactly the materials not slippery its tacky but because of the way that the liquid moves around inside it is hard to keep up with those dolphins theyre going all over the place there are also some sparkles in there 211 interesting i bet this 211 one looks good held up to the light too cause its 211 transparent translucent i suppose umm alright this 209 is an interesting dude so here 211 209 we have two different forms of intelligent life we have the dolphins 211 and the extraterrestrial 209 well im assuming hes 209 intelligent i dont know hmm but but he at least has that sort of stereotypical humanoid brand of intelligence green 209 he 209 seems very friendly though hes smiling hopefully hes 209 a friendly life form from another planet the brain 210 the brain squishy brain except this 210 ones not gray its 210 purple i wouldnt mind my brain being purple i think thats a lovely color uh interesting to think about using a brain as a stress relief ball of sorts theres 210 another like nod towards intelligence here brain 210 the alien 209 and the dolphins 211 and a heart 212 which is different like thats a different and its 212 a bead which is cool a heartshaped bead 212 i love red 212 reds one of my favorite colors so thats 212 interesting to me and the heart 212 is interesting in connection to these other 209211 things too dolphins 211 would have a heart the brain 210 and the heart would work together to power the body and i dont know if this 209 guy has a heart but one can imagine that he might he might or he 209 might heart earth get a tshirt that says i heart earth before he heads home yeahinteresting so in some ways this 213216 is the most similar set of things to each other has the most consistency within the set because here are four identically sized purses 213216 in silk satin asian fabric asian patterns maybe chinese maybe japanese im not sure and the silver trim or chrome trim they 213216 feel different though they 213216 dont all feel the same some are heavier some are lighter some have a crunchiness to them when i touch them some feel softer shakes 213216 in turn next to ear and they make different noises too not this 216 one so much but the others 213215 do and theyre 213216 all different colors and patterns as well and yet all pretty much the same shape and design which is interesting also interesting is the fact that they 213216 are becoming somewhat archaic in a moneyfree cashless society where everything is done through credit card mostly via phone these 213216 maybe are not as in use as they once were yeah people arent walking around with tons of coins or cash anymore mmmmalright well i see four pieces 217220 of cloth different types this 217220 reminds me going to fabric stores with my mom different colors 217220 too but all 217220 kind of roughly in the uchicago colors thats interesting ive got the maroon here 218 and the red felt 217 makes me think of school craft projects or christmas tree ornaments the lace 220 the white lace 220 very bridal i didnt wear white when i got married i wore red and im divorced now so i dont know what any of that means this 219 one has a pretty almost lacelike pattern to it even though its 219 just a cotton fabric i dont know all the names of fabrics very well i know this 217 is felt and this 220 is lace and then these 218 219 feel like cotton fabrics to me but im sure my mom would have some more specific words to put to them i like textiles i like i like how different fabrics feel to the touch i have a lot of different quilts around my house i like the the weight and the feeling and these 213216 arent particularly heavy in and of themselves but i can imagine them being made into some really lovely garment or or a blanket or something that would bring softness and comfort to whoever wore it or wrap themselves in ityeah this 221224 feels like upgrade wow yeah now these 221224 these fabrics are very fun to touch theres the velvet 221 and the fleece 222 and the faux fur 223 i assume faux fur and the burlap 224 yeah these 221224 these are all fun my cats would have fun with this too and my my kids actually itd be fun to rub and and touch so soft 222 umm theres a more of a wildness to some 222 223 of these you know in the ways that they imitate animal hides and furs i guess but theres also a luxuriousness but for the lace 220 these others 217219 feel more like everyday wear and but for the burlap 224 these 221223 feel more like special occasion or special use wouldnt necessarily have them 221223 on all the time but youd feel pretty fancy when you did yeah and again with the red 221 and the white 222 and the black 223 224 very very uchicago i like that yeahum just for me they have and this maybe im being influenced because we started with the toys but i am feeling a strong connection to childhood with all of them it feels like uh reminding me of toys and sports and if i didnt have these exact change purses im sure at various points i was given something similar or purchased on some family trip and then the fabrics remind me of going to fabric stores with my mom sewing projects at home my sister and i sewing clothes for our barbie dolls theres yeah i see i see them all as connected to to childhood', 'sentence-tokens': ['Ok, yeah, I think so.', 'Ok, yeah.', 'Ok, so I would say that these 201204 four things are all balls of a one type or another.', 'Some are softer than others.', 'This
