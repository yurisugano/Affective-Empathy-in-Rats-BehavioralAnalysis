# Affective-Empathy-in-Rats-BehavioralAnalysis

This project investigates the requirement of affective cues for pro-social behavior in rats. Groups received different pharmacological manipulations to reduce or remove affective cues with and without accompanying behavioral cues. The data analysis component consists on identifying the role of affective and behavioral cues in the likelihood of pro-social behavior.

For original pre-pring, see Helping can be driven by non-affective cues in rat. Y. Vieira Sugano, H.Z. Shan, N.M.R. Molasky, P. Mason. bioRxiv 2022.07.01.498150; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.01.498150

Note that the analysis in the pre-print version is not aligned with the analysis presented here. After careful consideration of the experimental setup, logistic regression and generalized mixed models were deemed more appropriate.
